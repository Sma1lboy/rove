/**
 * `bun e2e/hero-record.ts [--out=dir]` — record the README demo through the
 * sanctioned `/harness` path (`hero-serve.ts` must be running), then encode it
 * to `demo.mp4` + `demo.gif`.
 *
 * What it films is the pitch itself: two tasks alive at once, each on its own
 * worktree and branch, both driven from one TUI — a real follow-up typed into
 * each, real turns running side by side, and the diff of the work at the end.
 * Every pixel is the product's own rendering; nothing is staged in a mock.
 *
 * The turns are REAL, so the recording is nondeterministic and costs quota.
 * Waits are therefore advisory: a beat that never matches its marker times out
 * and the storyboard moves on, because a half-recorded demo is worth more than
 * a hung capture.
 *
 * Browser/PTY plumbing and the ffmpeg encode live in `hero-capture.ts`; this
 * file is only the storyboard. The kanban feature demo is `hero-kanban.ts`.
