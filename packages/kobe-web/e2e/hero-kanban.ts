/**
 * `bun e2e/hero-kanban.ts [--out=dir] [--speed=N]` — record the KANBAN
 * feature demo through the sanctioned `/harness` path (`hero-serve.ts` must
 * be running, against a board seeded by `hero-issues.ts`), then encode it to
 * `kanban.mp4` + `kanban.gif`.
 *
 * What it films is the board's own claim: the daemon-owned issue store as
 * Backlog / In progress / Done, a story you can open and edit, a story you
 * can file from the TUI — and a card that MOVES because an agent moved it.
 * That last beat is a real `rove api issue-update --task` fired from outside
 * the TUI while the page is open, which is exactly the call an agent makes;
 * the board's poll picks it up on camera. Nothing is staged in a mock.
 *
 * Unlike `hero-record.ts` this storyboard costs NO engine quota and is
 * deterministic — no live turn is involved. It deliberately stops short of
 * the drawer's Start action: a story started into its own worktree boots the
 * engine in a directory Claude Code has never seen, which raises the
 * first-run folder-trust prompt (see `hero-seed.ts`) and would film a modal
 * instead of the product. The drawer's engine / workspace / after-start
 * controls are still shown, so the capability is on screen.
 *
 * NOT idempotent: beat 4 files a real story and beat 5 creates the task it
 * gets linked to. Re-shoot from a clean board — `bun e2e/hero-fixture.ts
 * --fresh && bun e2e/hero-issues.ts` — or the extra cards pile up.
