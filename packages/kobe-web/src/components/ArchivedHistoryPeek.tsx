/**
 * ArchivedHistoryPeek — beta read-only preview of an archived task's engine
 * history (Settings → Experimental → "Archived history preview").
 *
 * An archived task's git worktree is usually gone (it was archived precisely
 * because `git worktree remove` ran). Its transcript, however, lives in the
 * engine's own vendor store keyed by the worktree PATH STRING — claude's
 * `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/*`, codex's `~/.codex/sessions/**` — which
 * the deletion never touched. So `ChatTranscript`, which already reads through
 * the neutral `/api/history/*` routes keyed by `worktreePath` + `vendor`, renders
 * the full history unchanged; we just host it in a docked drawer with no live
 * PTY / engine tab. Pure read surface — no write path is wired here.
