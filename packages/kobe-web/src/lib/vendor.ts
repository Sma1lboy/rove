/**
 * vendor — the SPA's vendor-identity rules, in one place.
 *
 * "Which engine does a task run, what do we call it, and does this workspace
 * mix engines?" used to be split three ways: `engines.ts` owned the label
 * lookup, `task-list.ts` owned the vendor aggregations, and the per-row
 * "label only when mixed" rule was inlined in AppShell — each independently
 * coalescing an unset `task.vendor` to the literal `"claude"`. This module owns
 * all of it, so the unset-vendor default lives in ONE place ({@link
 * DEFAULT_VENDOR}) and the rules are unit-testable without rendering a row.
 *
 * `engines.ts` keeps ONLY its job: fetching the engine-owned list from the
 * bridge (`useEngines` + {@link EngineOption}). This module takes that list as
 * input — it never fetches — so it stays pure and react-free (type-only import
 * of `EngineOption`, no runtime cycle).

 * forbids hard-coding vendor strings in UI logic; the accepted exception is
 * this single named fallback constant, not scattered literals.)
