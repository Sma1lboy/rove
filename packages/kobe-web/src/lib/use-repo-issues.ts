/**
 * use-repo-issues — the issue-snapshot data plumbing, held apart from any one
 * page so the Board can render a repo's issues without re-deriving the
 * fetch/seq/live-push machinery.
 *
 * Two truth sources, merged per repo into one cache:
 *   1. an initial `/api/issues` GET per repo (and on demand via `refresh`);
 *   2. live `issue.snapshot` daemon pushes (any surface — another browser,
 *      the TUI, `kobe api issue-*`) replayed through the store's
 *      `issueSnapshots`.
 * An out-of-order guard (the DiffView seqRef pattern, per repo) stamps every
 * request and drops a stale response, so an in-flight GET can never overwrite
 * a fresher mutation/push. There is NO optimistic layer — the daemon issue
 * store is the only truth (the board optimistically HIDES a just-started issue
 * by a separate task-side mechanism, not here).
