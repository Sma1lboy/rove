/**
 * tab-kinds — the single registry of workspace tab kinds.
 *
 * A tab's kind drives two cross-cutting facts: whether it owns a server-side
 * PTY (so closing or pruning the tab must tear that PTY down) and how a fresh
 * tab of the kind is titled. Both are declared here rather than string-matched
 * at each site, so adding or changing a kind is one registry entry and the
 * rules are unit-tested in isolation.
 *
 * Pure + React-free: the per-kind RENDER (a component) stays in WorkspaceTabs'
 * type-narrowing switch, where the discriminated union keeps it type-safe — a
 * render dispatch table would trade that safety for indirection. This registry
 * owns the DATA about a kind, not its UI.
