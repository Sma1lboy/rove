# kobe-web

The local browser dashboard for Rove — a terminal-native workspace for running
many AI coding sessions at once, in the browser. Full architecture (process
model, daemon channels, route table) lives in
[`docs/design/web-dashboard.md`](../../docs/design/web-dashboard.md).

## Three processes

`node-pty` doesn't work under Bun, and a terminal crash must never take the
daemon down — so the dashboard is split into three cooperating processes:

- **SPA** — React + TanStack Router, served by Vite in dev (`:5173`).
- **Daemon web transport** — loopback HTTP/SSE routes hosted by the Rove daemon
  (`:45174` by default for `rove web`).
- **PTY sidecar** (`pty-server.mjs`) — a node process (`:5175`) running each
  engine/terminal tab's PTY.

## Develop

```bash
bun run dev            # all three processes; opens http://localhost:5173
bun run dev:sandbox    # same, but pointed at a throwaway KOBE_HOME_DIR so the
                       # task index, daemon, Hosted PTY Host, and web sidecar
                       # never touch production state
```

`bun run dev` connects to your production daemon and **production** `~/.rove` data — the startup
banner says which home it's wired to. Use `dev:sandbox` when you don't want to
mutate real tasks.

## Test, lint, build

```bash
bun run test    # vitest — touches NO daemon (fake links / pure helpers); safe anytime
bun run check   # biome lint + format (gate this by exit code)
bun run build   # vite build → dist/ (what `rove web` serves in production)
```

The repo-root `bun run lint` does NOT cover this package — run `bun run check`
here.

## Production

The canonical `@sma1lboy/rove` package bundles this web dashboard under
`dist/web-ui`. Source checkouts can use `bun run dev` / `bun run dev:sandbox`;
installed packages can run `rove web`, which serves the built SPA through the
daemon web transport and spawns the PTY sidecar on `port + 2`:

```bash
rove web                 # http://localhost:45174
rove web --port 5180
```

## What it does

- **Left rail** — live tasks from the daemon (sort, filter, `j`/`k` nav, change
  chips, PR/activity). New Task + Adopt-worktree dialogs.
- **Center** — per-task workspace tabs (client-owned, localStorage): engine PTY
  (with a prompt composer + reattach), shell PTY, structured Chat transcript,
  and diff file previews.
- **Right** — task metadata (rename/branch/status/vendor/pin/delete),
  a markdown notes scratchpad (with preview), and a live Changes/diff rail.
- **More** — command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+K), `?` keyboard help, an Overview
  triage route (`/overview`), deep links (`/task/:id`), live theme sync + a
  Settings theme picker, desktop notifications, and a root error boundary.
