/**
 * `bun e2e/hero-seed.ts` — run the REAL engine sessions the README assets are
 * shot around: two tasks working at once on DISJOINT files, each on its own
 * worktree and branch. That is the product's claim, so it is photographed
 * rather than asserted.
 *
 * Costs real quota and is nondeterministic by construction — two live turns.
 * Budget a few minutes, and expect the transcript (and so the framing) to
 * differ between runs. Already-seeded tasks are left alone, so a re-shoot
 * reuses the sessions it has already paid for; `hero-fixture.ts --fresh`
 * starts over.
 *
 * Two things have to be arranged before the engine starts, or the turn stalls
 * where no operator is watching:
 *
 * - **Folder trust.** A Rove worktree is its own git root, so Claude Code
 *   treats it as a new project and opens "Is this a project you trust?" —
 *   trust on an ancestor does NOT carry into it. That dialog cannot simply be
 *   answered after the fact: the task's prompt rides in on argv, and
 *   accepting the dialog drops it, leaving a live session that never got
 *   asked anything. So the worktree is materialized first
 *   (`ensure-worktree`), recorded as trusted, and only then handed a prompt.
 *   The record is additive — an entry the operator already has is never
 *   rewritten, and nothing else in the file is touched.
 * - **Command approval.** `acceptEdits` covers file edits only. Both prompts
 *   end in a commit, and a bare Bash call would stop on an approval nobody is
 *   there to answer, so `hero-fixture.ts` pins `--allowedTools "Bash(git *)"`
 *   as the narrow fix — never `bypassPermissions`, which would hand an
 *   unattended agent the operator's real HOME.
