/**
 * Shared daemon-stop primitive.
 *
 * `kobe daemon restart` and `kobe reset` both need to make a daemon
 * actually GO AWAY — not just ask it to — before they continue (restart
 * respawns onto the same socket; reset leaves it stopped). The escalation
 * dance below lived inline in `daemon restart`; it's extracted here so the
 * two callers share one battle-tested kill path instead of drifting.
 *
 * Why an escalation at all: a `daemon.stop` RPC is the happy path, but a
 * wedged daemon (stuck in its own shutdown, or not servicing the socket)
 * would otherwise outlive the caller. A fresh daemon spawned onto the same
 * socket then races EADDRINUSE (or worse, two daemons end up writing one
 * `tasks.json`). So we poll the old pid with `kill -0` and escalate
 * graceful → SIGTERM → SIGKILL until it's confirmed gone.
