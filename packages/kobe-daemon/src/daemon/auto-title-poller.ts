/**
 * Daemon-side live auto-title poller (KOB — auto-name live).
 *
 * A freshly-created task keeps its placeholder title `(new task)` until a
 * transcript contains its first usable user prompt. This daemon poller
 * derives the title without requiring any UI to stay attached.
 *
 * The engine still writes the conversation to its OWN on-disk transcript
 * (the same JSONL the Ops activity badge in `monitor/activity.ts` watches).
 * This poller reads that store on an interval for every still-placeholder
 * task and renames as soon as the first user message lands — no detach
 * required. The rename flows through `orch.setTitle` → `store.update` →
 * the `task.snapshot` broadcast, so every attached Tasks pane updates live.
 *
 * Self-limiting: only placeholder tasks touch disk (`deriveTitleFromSession`
 * returns `""` and the task keeps its placeholder when no usable user
 * message exists yet); once a task is named it's skipped on every later
 * tick. Best-effort: a per-task failure is logged, never fatal, and never
 * blocks the other tasks in the same tick.
 *
 * The detach-time rename in `tui/direct.ts` stays as a
 * belt-and-suspenders path for the case where the daemon isn't running
 * (e.g. a `kobe` started without a live daemon).
