/**
 * Multi-source activity arbitration — the herdr model
 * (`refs/herdr/src/terminal/state.rs` `recompute_effective_state`) applied to
 * one tab's activity state.
 *
 * Every status SOURCE writes its own slot; nobody edits anybody else's:
 *
 *   - `hook`     — engine hook events (`report()`). Authoritative while the
 *                  engine lives: hooks see turn boundaries, permission
 *                  prompts, and rate limits that no amount of screen/PTY
 *                  watching can. Idle is never stored — a hook idle CLEARS
 *                  the slot (the tab went quiet on the record).
 *   - `observed` — the activity observer's PTY/foreground facts
 *                  (`observeTab()`). Fills the holes hooks leave by omission
 *                  (ESC interrupt, daemon restart, dead engine) and provides
 *                  the KNOWN-idle marker that distinguishes "we looked, it's
 *                  resting" from "no signal" (the client's `◌` unknown).
 *
 * `recomputeTabActivity` is the ONE place the priority order lives — add a
 * source by adding a slot and a rule here, never by special-casing a writer:
 *
 *   1. a hook entry in a STICKY state (`turn_complete` / `permission_needed`
 *      / `error` / `rate_limited` / `dead`) always wins — those mean "a human
 *      should look", carry no output by nature, and observation must never dim
 *      them. `dead` is the strongest case: the process is GONE, so no live
 *      claim about it can be true, and observation can only ever answer "at
 *      rest" — which is precisely what made a killed engine read as an idle
 *      one. It is displaced only by a newer hook event, i.e. a new session in
 *      the same tab.
 *   2. a hook `running` wins UNLESS an observed `rest` fact is fresher than
 *      the claim (herdr's `fallback_not_older_than_hook` — a stale
 *      observation must never idle a fresh turn) AND the claim is at least
 *      `correctHookRunningAfterMs` old (at a turn boundary the PTY evidence
 *      trails the hook by one poll) — then observation corrects it (the
 *      ESC-interrupt / dead-engine gap).
 *   3. any other hook entry wins.
 *   4. no hook entry → the observed slot wins: `running` fills the hole a
 *      daemon restart left, `idle` is the known-idle marker.
 *   5. neither → undefined: unknown, distinguishable from known-idle.
 *
 * Pure: no timers, no bus, no I/O — the registry owns those.
