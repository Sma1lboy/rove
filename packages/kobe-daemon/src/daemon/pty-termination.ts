 *
 * Windows has neither process groups to signal nor signals at all — the

 * calls `TerminateProcess`. That makes even the SIGTERM step a hard kill on
 * Windows, so an engine never gets to flush; tracked separately rather than
 * papered over here.
 *
 * Every signal Rove sends a PTY subtree goes through here, so `onSignal` is
 * the complete record of Rove's own killing. A receiver cannot learn its
 * killer's pid on POSIX (that needs `SA_SIGINFO`, which Node does not
 * expose), so post-mortem attribution is elimination only: no line here for
 * a dead engine's group means something OUTSIDE Rove sent the signal.
