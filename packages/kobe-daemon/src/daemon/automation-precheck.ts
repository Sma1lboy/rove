/**
 * Automation precheck: a shell command run BEFORE the engine starts, whose
 * exit code decides whether the run is worth doing at all.
 *
 * Why this exists: the dominant waste in scheduled agent work is firing on
 * time when nothing changed — the engine still boots, reads the repo, and
 * burns a turn to conclude "nothing to do". A precheck lets a cheap shell
 * command (`gh pr list ...`, `git log --since ...`) make that call for
 * roughly zero cost, so the expensive path only runs when there is work.
 *
 * Contract: exit 0 ⇒ proceed. Anything else — non-zero, timeout, spawn
 * failure — means SKIP. Failing closed is deliberate: a broken precheck must
 * not silently degrade into "run every time", which is the exact cost the
 * feature exists to avoid. The skip is recorded with its output so the user
 * can tell a healthy "nothing to do" from a broken command.
 *
 * Runs through the user's login shell so the command reads the same as it
 * would typed into a terminal (pipes, `&&`, PATH/exports from their rc
 * files). It uses the same `-ilc` form `session-launch.ts` spawns engine
 * tabs with (#26): the interactive bit is what sources `.zshrc`/`.bashrc`,
 * so a precheck sees the same environment as the engine it gates. Interactive
 * rc output (e.g. a prompt framework's banner) rides along in the captured
 * streams; the exit code stays the only decision signal, and the timeout
 * bounds a slow rc.
 * `resolveLoginShell` resolves to a bash even on Windows (Git Bash — see its
 * WSL caveat), so the `-ilc` form is portable.

 * a pipe's `data` events at arbitrary byte offsets, so a multi-byte UTF-8
 * sequence can straddle two chunks. Decoding each `Buffer` on its own — the
 * old `chunks.map((c) => c.toString())` — turns that seam into a `�`, so a
 * `gh pr list` full of CJK/emoji titles came back mojibake. Concatenate each
 * contiguous run of Buffers and decode it as one instead.
 *
 * Cap by whole code points, not UTF-16 units, so the tail slice can't halve a
 * surrogate pair and strand a lone surrogate at the cut.
