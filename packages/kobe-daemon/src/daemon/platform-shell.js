/**
 * The POSIX login shell every kobe PTY spawns through, and the path form
 * that shell understands.
 *
 * kobe's engine-launch contract (`packages/kobe/src/engine/session-launch.ts`)
 * is a POSIX shell SCRIPT, not an argv: `trap ':' INT`, `export -p`, `$$`,
 * `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}`, `kill -TERM`, `[ -f ]`, `exec "${SHELL:-/bin/sh}"`.
 * Every engine tab and every embedded terminal is spawned through it, so
 * porting it to a second cmd/PowerShell dialect would fork the single code
 * path the whole product runs on — twice the surface, twice the drift.
 *
 * Windows therefore gets a real POSIX shell rather than a second dialect:
 * Git for Windows ships bash plus full coreutils, and kobe is git-worktree
 * native, so every machine that can run kobe at all already has it. This
 * module is the ONLY place that knows any of that — callers keep passing
 * `-il` / `-ilc` and keep composing one POSIX script.
 *
 * POSIX behaviour is deliberately unchanged: each call site passes the
 * fallback it always used (`/bin/zsh`, `/bin/bash`, `/bin/sh`), so this is
 * additive on macOS and Linux.
