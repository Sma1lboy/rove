/**
 * Daemon-side worktree-changes collector (issue #6).
 *
 * Before this, EVERY pane process polled `git status` itself for the
 * sidebar's per-row `+N −M` chips (`tui/panes/sidebar/worktree-changes-poller.ts`
 * riding `tui/lib/background-poll.ts`) — N panes × M tasks of duplicated
 * background subprocesses doing identical work. The daemon is now the
 * SINGLE collector: one guarded `git status --porcelain=v1` per local
 * worktree, fanned out on the `worktree.changes` channel. Panes render
 * the pushes and spawn ZERO git processes while daemon-connected; the
 * pane-local poller survives only as the no-daemon fallback.
 *
 * The scheduling guards are the SAME ones the TUI poller uses against
 * huge-repo `git status` stalls (shared via `@/lib/poll-scheduling`, extracted from background-poll so
 * the daemon doesn't import the TUI's solid-js signal layer):
 *
 *   - **in-flight dedupe** — one `git status` per worktree at a time;
 *     ticks landing mid-run are dropped.
 *   - **timeout + SIGKILL** — a status walk exceeding
 *     {@link WORKTREE_CHANGES_TIMEOUT_MS} is aborted and the child killed.
 *   - **hard backoff** — a timed-out worktree is left alone for
 *     {@link WORKTREE_CHANGES_SLOW_RETRY_MS} (the repo is too big to poll
 *     at tick cadence).
 *   - **adaptive cadence** — the next run waits
 *     `max(minIntervalMs, 5 × last duration)`, so slow-but-finishing
 *     repos self-thin without a special case.
 *
 * Collection scope: every task with a LOCAL worktree. Remote (`ssh://`)
 * projects are skipped — their worktrees aren't on this filesystem.
 * Deleted tasks' entries DROP from the published map on the next
 * tick. `main` tasks collect like any other (worktreePath = repo root —
 * the PROJECTS rows show the same chip); tasks sharing a worktree path
 * (main rows of the same repo) dedupe naturally on the path key.
 *
 * Publish contract: the FULL map, republished only when membership or a
 * value actually changed — the bus's last-value replay then hands a late
 * subscriber the whole picture in one frame, and unchanged ticks cost
 * subscribers nothing. Reads are `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0` (inspect, don't
 * write — never take `.git/index.lock` from under the engine's own
 * commits) and best-effort: a failed/timed-out run keeps the entry's last
 * value, never throws, never publishes garbage.
