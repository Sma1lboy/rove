/**
 * DaemonLifetime — the daemon's "should I still be running, and should my
 * collectors?" policy, extracted from `server.ts` into one testable seam.
 * (Distinct from `lifecycle.ts`, which kills an EXTERNAL daemon process.)
 *
 * Three interdependent rules live here instead of as loose functions + a
 * shared `stopping` flag scattered across the server closure (`guiCount`,
 * `hasSubscribers`, `cancelIdleTimer`, `maybeArmIdleShutdown`, and the timer
 * callback). They are really ONE policy keyed on which front-ends are attached:
 *
 *  1. **Lazy shutdown** — the daemon's lifetime is bound to attached GUIs
 *     (`role: "gui"` subscribers — the `holdsLifetime` flag). When the LAST gui
 *     disconnects we wait a short grace, then self-stop. We arm only on a
 *     >0 → 0 gui transition (never on boot), so a deliberately gui-less
 *     `kobe daemon start` / freshly-respawned `daemon restart` stays up. A gui
 *     (re)attach cancels a pending grace; a pane subscribing during the grace
 *     must NOT.
 *  2. **Collector gate** — the background collectors (worktree-changes,
 *     auto-title) exist to feed an attached pane, so they pause while there are
 *     zero subscribers (gui OR pane) and resume once one subscribes.
 *  3. **Stopping** — once teardown begins, neither rule may re-fire.
 *
 * The source of truth stays the server's live `clients` set (passed as a
 * provider), so there is NO counter to drift out of sync with re-subscribes,
 * role changes, or unsubscribed socket closes — the policy just scans it. What
 * this module owns is the timer, the `stopping` flag, and the arm/cancel rules,
 * with an injectable clock so the policy is unit-testable without a real socket
 * or a wall-clock grace.
