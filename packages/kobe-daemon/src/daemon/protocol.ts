 * version it can still talk to ({@link MIN_COMPATIBLE_PROTOCOL_VERSION}),
 * and unknown extra fields are ignored. A backward-compatible change bumps
 * `DAEMON_PROTOCOL_VERSION` while leaving `MIN_COMPATIBLE_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
 * put, so a newer daemon keeps serving a slightly-older TUI through a
 * rolling upgrade instead of hard-rejecting it. Bump the MIN only on a
 * breaking change.
 *
 * v3: `daemon.web.start` / `daemon.web.stop` removed from the socket protocol.
 * Browser HTTP/SSE now lives on the daemon-owned web transport instead of a
 * socket RPC that starts/stops routes. A v2 client's `kobe web` gets a clear
 * "unknown daemon request" error; everything else still interoperates, so MIN
 * stays 2.
 *
 * v4: daemon-hosted PTYs (`pty.*` requests + targeted `pty.data`/`pty.exit`
 * event frames). Additive — an older client never sends `pty.*`, a newer
 * client against an older daemon gets "unknown daemon request" and falls back
 * to a local PTY — so MIN stays 2.
