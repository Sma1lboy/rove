/**
 * Liveness probe for the activity lapse watchdog: resolve taskId → worktree +
 * vendor, then read the engine's transcript for the two facts the watchdog
 * needs (`activity-registry.ts` → `stillWorking`).
 *
 * Split out of `server.ts` (which is at its size cap and is otherwise pure
 * wiring) because this is a real policy decision, not a construction step:
 *
 * - `mtimeMs` answers "is anything still being written". Alone it is NOT
 *   enough — an engine parked at its prompt keeps touching its transcript, so
 *   a missed Stop hook re-armed the watchdog forever and the sidebar spinner
 *   never stopped.
 * - `completedAt` is the newest turn-COMPLETION marker, which answers the
 *   question actually being asked: did this turn already end?
 *
 * Finding the completion already walks the transcript dir and stats its files,
 * so `latestActivity()` yields both from ONE scan — no extra IO versus the
 * mtime-only probe it replaces. Vendors with no completion markers keep the
 * plain mtime heartbeat; there is no "turn ended" fact to read for them.
 *
 * Best-effort by contract: the caller treats a throw as "silent" ⇒ lapse.
