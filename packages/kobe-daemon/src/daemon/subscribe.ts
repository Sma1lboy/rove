/**
 * The `subscribe` request — the ONE request that is not a registry handler.
 *
 * It is connection lifecycle, not RPC: it mutates per-socket state
 * (`subscribed`, `holdsLifetime`, `channels`), drives the gui-refcount
 * idle-grace timer, and writes event frames out-of-band during channel replay.
 * None of that fits the registry's payload→result shape, so it lives here
 * beside its own machinery instead of pretending to be a handler.
