/**
 * PtyLiveHold — a keep-alive source for `DaemonLifetime`: "the standalone
 * PTY host still owns at least one live session".
 *
 * Why it exists: the daemon is the only collector of `kobe hook` activity
 * events, and hooks deliberately never spawn a daemon (`hook-cmd.ts`). Before
 * this hold, the last gui detaching idle-stopped the daemon while hosted
 * engines kept running in the pty host — every event they fired during the
 * gap was dropped, and the in-memory activity registry (never persisted)
 * came back empty, blanking the running/attention dots until the next turn
 * boundary. Holding the daemon open while sessions live keeps the event
 * stream unbroken, which is the whole accuracy story for the dots.
 *
 * Shape mirrors the automations keep-alive: `DaemonLifetime` reads a sync
 * `isHeld()` at its arm/fire points, and the true→false transition calls
 * `onRelease` (wired to `lifetime.reevaluateIdle()`) — the same hole-plug
 * automations need when their last schedule is deleted. Because the pty host
 * is a separate process, the cached flag is refreshed by polling its socket:
 * a slow interval for the steady state, plus `probeSoon()` on gui disconnect
 * so the idle-grace recheck reads a fresh value instead of a poll-stale one.
 * The probe never spawns a host; an unreadable host keeps the hold until absence is confirmed.
 */
