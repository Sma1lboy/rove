/**
 * Shared directory-watch trigger for daemon channels backed by files.
 *
 * State-like files in kobe are commonly written with tmp+rename. Watching the
 * file inode directly goes stale after the first rename, so daemon fan-out
 * modules watch the parent directory, filter by filename, and debounce bursts.
 * This module owns those mechanics; callers provide only the file path and the
 * action to run when it changes.
 *
 * The watcher is backed by chokidar, which already smooths over the
 * cross-platform fs-event edge cases (macOS rename/inode churn, rapid bursts,
 * atomic saves) without a hand-rolled polling safety-net.
