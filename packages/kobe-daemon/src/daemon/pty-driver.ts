/**
 * How a PTY child gets spawned — the one runtime-specific seam in the PTY
 * host.
 *
 * `PtyHost` owns sessions, scrollback, replay, and lifetime; none of that
 * cares which API produced the pseudo-terminal. Two drivers exist because no
 * single API covers every platform kobe runs on:
 *
 *   - `bunTerminalDriver` — `Bun.spawn(..., { terminal })`. The default, and
 *     the only one used on macOS and Linux.
 *   - `nodePtyDriver` — `node-pty` (ConPTY). Windows only, and it must run
 *     under NODE: Bun can import node-pty and read from it, but writing to
 *     the ConPTY input pipe fails with `ERR_SOCKET_CLOSED`, so a Bun-hosted
 *     node-pty session is one you cannot type into. Bun's own `terminal`
 *     option is rejected outright on Windows ("terminal option is not
 *     supported on this platform"), which is why the Windows PTY host is a
 *     separate node process rather than the usual Bun one.
 *
 * Keeping the seam this narrow is deliberate: everything above it — the ring
 * buffer, OSC title scanning, park/replay, sweep — stays single-implementation
 * and identically tested on every platform.
