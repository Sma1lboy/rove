/**
 * Daemon-side transcript-activity collector (perf — deduplicate
 * per-Ops-pane polling).
 *
 * Before this, EVERY `kobe ops` pane process polled the engine transcript
 * store itself: the `● new` badge readdir'd + stat'd the worktree's
 * transcript dir on a 2.5–20s adaptive timer (`monitor/activity`'s
 * `latestTranscriptMtime`), and the ChatTab "done" chip re-read + re-parsed
 * the newest session JSONL on a 1.5s timer for the engine-owned completion
 * marker (`engine/turn-detector`). Each ChatTab runs its own Ops pane, so a
 * worktree with W tabs paid W× that filesystem churn — at total rest. The
 * daemon is now the SINGLE collector for the SHAREABLE, filesystem half:
 * one guarded probe per local worktree producing `{ mtimeMs, completionId,
 * completionAt }`, fanned out on the `transcript.activity` channel. Panes
 * render the pushes and stat/parse ZERO transcripts while daemon-connected;
 * the pane-local probes survive only as the no-daemon / old-daemon fallback.
 *
 * ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
 * ║  HARD CONSTRAINT — this collector does FILESYSTEM reads ONLY.         ║
 * ║  CLAUDE.md: "daemon shutdown never touches tmux." The per-window      ║
 * ║  `tmux capture-pane` quiescence hashing and the `@kobe_tab_state`     ║
 * ║  `setWindowOption` write STAY in the Ops pane process (ops/host.tsx). ║
 * ║  This file MUST NOT import `@/tmux/*` or anything that drives tmux —  ║
 * ║  it reads the engine's on-disk transcript store and nothing else.    ║
 * ║  Moving capture-pane daemon-side would defeat the whole design.      ║
 * ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
 *
 * Scheduling reuses the SAME guards as the worktree-changes collector
 * (shared via `@/lib/poll-scheduling`): in-flight dedupe (one probe per
 * worktree at a time), adaptive cadence (next run waits `max(minInterval,
 * 5 × last duration)` so a slow JSONL parse self-thins), and a hard backoff
 * after a timeout. The long-lived per-worktree `EngineTurnDetector` is held
 * across ticks so its mtime-gated memo survives — a quiescent worktree
 * re-stats the transcript dir but does NOT re-parse the JSONL.
 *
 * Collection scope mirrors the git collector: every NON-ARCHIVED task with
 * a LOCAL worktree. Archived tasks and remote (`ssh://`) projects are
 * skipped — their transcripts aren't on this filesystem (or shouldn't be
 * polled). Tasks sharing a worktree path collapse to one slot; the first
 * task in list order picks the vendor deterministically (completion markers
 * are vendor-specific). Deleted/archived tasks' entries DROP on the next
 * tick.
 *
 * Publish contract: the FULL map, republished only when membership or a
 * value actually changed — the bus's last-value replay then hands a late
 * subscriber the whole picture in one frame, and unchanged ticks cost
 * subscribers nothing. Reads are best-effort: a failed/timed-out probe
 * keeps the entry's last value, never throws, never publishes garbage.
 * `stop()` clears the timer only — NO tmux, no held filesystem handles.
