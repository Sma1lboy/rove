/**
 * Daemon-side watcher for the user keybindings file
 * (`~/.rove/settings/keybindings.yaml`) — the second live-prefs fan-out,
 * sibling to `ui-prefs-watcher.ts`.
 *
 * The TUI applies keybinding overrides ONCE at boot (`applyUserKeybindings`
 * onto the in-memory `KobeKeymap`), so without a push, editing the YAML
 * would need a full session rebuild before any pane saw the new chords. This
 * watcher is the cross-session trigger: watch the file and publish a
 * monotonically-bumping `rev` on the `keybindings` channel. A pane doesn't
 * need the file CONTENT from us — it re-reads + re-applies the file itself
 * (it owns the keymap registry); the channel is purely the "re-read now"
 * ping, fanned out to every session at once.
 *
 * The watch mechanics mirror `ui-prefs-watcher.ts` exactly (watch the
 * DIRECTORY so an editor's tmp+rename doesn't kill an inode-bound file
 * watch; debounce a write burst; best-effort, never fatal). The one
 * difference: there's no "changed-only" compare — any touch of the file
 * bumps the rev, because the daemon deliberately doesn't parse the YAML
 * (the TUI owns validation). A no-op edit costing one harmless re-apply in
 * each pane is the accepted trade for keeping the daemon keymap-neutral.
