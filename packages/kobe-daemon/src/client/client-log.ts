/**
 * Client-side diagnostic log (the mirror of `daemon/crash-log.ts`).
 *
 * kobe's in-tmux panes (`kobe tasks`, `kobe ops`) and the front-end attach
 * run inside an opentui alternate-screen, so anything written to
 * stdout/stderr is painted over by the TUI and lost. That is exactly why
 * the Tasks-pane sync drift went undiagnosed: the pane logged
 * "daemon subscribe unavailable" / silently froze on a socket close, but no
 * human ever saw it. This module appends tagged, timestamped lines to a
 * real file (`<home>/.kobe/client.log`) so connection-lifecycle events —
 * subscribe, disconnect, reconnect attempts, fallbacks — leave a trace.
 *
 * Append-only + best-effort + NON-BLOCKING: a logging failure must NEVER
 * take down a pane, AND a log write must never stall the pane's event loop.
 * Some call sites are on the socket data handler (a guarded JSON-parse
 * failure) and the reconnect backoff loop, so the write is fire-and-forget
 * async `appendFile` (O_APPEND keeps each line atomic even with several pane
 * processes writing the same file) — never `appendFileSync`. Every error
 * path is swallowed so a stray rejection can't escape into a pane that has
 * no unhandled-rejection net.
