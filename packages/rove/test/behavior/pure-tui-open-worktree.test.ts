 * dropped and a fixed one-shot wait then flakes (the recurring
 * `expected [] to deeply equal [repo]` failure). Retrying the press is
 * the deterministic harness-level fix; assertions below use set/count
 * semantics so extra presses can't break them.
 *
 * Do NOT re-send `ctrl+q` inside this loop to "re-assert" sidebar focus:
 * that chord is NOT idempotent. `focus.sidebar` (scope workspace) returns
 * to the sidebar, but `app.quit` binds BOTH `q` and `ctrl+q` in scope
 * sidebar — so once focus is already there, the same byte opens the quit
 * confirm, whose modal barrier then swallows every `o` for the rest of the
 * loop. It turns an occasional slow-boot flake into a deterministic failure
 * on every retry.
