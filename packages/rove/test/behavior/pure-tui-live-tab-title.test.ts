/**
 * Regression pin: a sidebar tab row's TITLE must
 * track the live session, like the state glyph beside it already does — not
 * wait for you to click into that task.
 *
 * The OSC title only ever reached a tab through `useTabTurnState`, which is
 * mounted by `TerminalTabs` — and `TerminalTabs` exists only for the SELECTED
 * task. So every other row rendered the persisted `lastTitle`: a recording of
 * whatever the tab was called the last time you were in it, sitting next to a
 * state glyph the daemon keeps live. One row, one live signal and one frozen
 * one.
 *
 * Shape: two tasks, focus pinned to A, and B's snapshot deliberately carrying
 * a STALE recording while B's engine publishes a different title. B is never
 * opened. The row must read the live title — which is only knowable from the
 * pty host, since nothing in this process ever attached to B.
