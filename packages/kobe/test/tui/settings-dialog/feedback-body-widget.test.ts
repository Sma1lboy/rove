/**
 * Pins the newline-normalization contract for the settings dialog's text
 * fields (`FeedbackSettingsSection` in `src/tui/component/settings-dialog/
 * sections.tsx`) and its siblings.
 *
 * The bug (Fix B): the feedback "description" was an opentui `<input>`,
 * which strips newlines INSIDE the native widget on paste/insert — so a
 * multi-line pasted bug report was silently collapsed to one line (pure
 * data loss). The fix makes the description a `<textarea>` and applies NO
 * newline stripping to it, so paragraph structure survives; the
 * single-line fields (title, branch, repo, prompt) keep `stripNewlines`
 * and stay on one line.
 *
 * This suite asserts the two normalizers at the logic layer:
 *   - single-line fields → `stripNewlines` (collapses to one line)
 *   - description body   → identity (preserves `\n`)
 *
 * Note: the live widget behavior (InputRenderable strips, TextareaRenderable
 * preserves) is verified out-of-band — tests here deliberately do NOT import
 * `@opentui/core` (its renderer retains native memory and can't load under
 * vitest/node; see the header of `test/tui/terminal-sgr.test.ts`).
