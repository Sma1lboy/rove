/**
 * What's left here after the golden took over.
 *
 * `test/golden/sidebar-row-state.golden.txt` now enumerates
 * `buildSidebarRowView` over its whole input space — every activity state ×
 * seen bit × job × deletion phase × vendor × transcript, plus the spinner sets,
 * the completion grace window, subagent marks and subtitle truncation. Every
 * per-state assertion that used to live in this file was one sampled row of
 * that table, so those cases were removed rather than kept as a second, less
 * complete copy that could disagree with it.
 *
 * What stayed is what a table of outputs cannot say:
 *
 *  - a COLLAPSE across an axis the golden deliberately excludes (persisted
 *    lifecycle status must have no effect on runtime chrome at all — the
 *    assertion is "all six statuses produce ONE projection", which is a
 *    property, not a row);
 *  - agreement BETWEEN two functions (`rowIsLoading` / `anyRowLoading` vs the
 *    view's own `loading`), which no single snapshot can express;
 *  - `sweepBar`, which belongs to a different module entirely.
