/**
 * Drift guard for the Claude Code plugin (`claude-plugin/` at the repo root).
 *
 * The plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` is a static copy of what the Claude hook
 * adapter would write into `~/.claude/settings.json` — same events, same
 * matchers, same `hook <verb> --engine claude` commands, just invoked through
 * the bundled `bin/rove` wrapper by absolute `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` path.
 * Static copies drift, so this test derives the expected set from the SAME
 * source of truth the adapter uses ({@link CLAUDE_HOOK_EVENT_MAP}) and fails
 * the moment either side moves without the other.
 *
 * The bundled skill is likewise a copy of `.agents/skills/kobe/SKILL.md`
 * (the canonical skill the npx installer ships); byte-identity keeps the two
 * install paths teaching the same thing.
