/**
 * Rename guard for CURRENT documentation, landing copy, active agent skills,
 * and the generated docs illustrations.
 *
 * `package-distribution.test.ts` pins the npm/repository contract and
 * `active-product-copy.test.ts` pins retired-architecture claims. Neither sees
 * the third failure mode of the Kobe -> Rove rename: a page that still tells a
 * user to run `kobe …`, or prints a state path / branch prefix Rove no longer
 * writes. Those are silent because they are only wrong for NEW users.
 *
 * NEGATIVE assertions only, same rule as `active-product-copy.test.ts`: assert
 * the absence of the stale spelling, never the presence of an exact sentence.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT covered here, because they are preserved compatibility:
 * the `kobe` executable and `@sma1lboy/kobe` package, `KOBE_*` env aliases,
 * `packages/kobe*` workspace names, `~/.kobe` runtime + plugin paths, legacy
 * `.kobe/worktrees` discovery, the `kobe-plugin` topic,
 * the installed `.agents/skills/kobe/SKILL.md` path,
 * and the persisted `kobe hook` invocation.
 * `[KOBE PEER]`/`[KOBE FIELD NOTE]` LEFT this list 2026-08-25 (owner call):
 * the message prefixes are read by LLMs, not parsed by code, so they renamed
 * to `[ROVE PEER]`/`[ROVE FIELD NOTE]` with no compat shim — guarded below.
 * Historical records (`docs/adr/`, `docs/superpowers/`, CHANGELOG, and the
 * superseded design notes) keep their original wording on purpose.
