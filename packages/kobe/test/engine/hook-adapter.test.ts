/**
 * Unit tests for `src/engine/hook-adapter.ts` — the neutral engine-hook seam.
 *
 * Why these matter: `createEngineHookAdapter` is the one place the
 * orchestrator resolves a vendor to its hook installer, and NoopHookAdapter
 * is the contract-completeness backstop for engines without wired hooks
 * (Copilot, custom engines). If the noop half ever starts claiming hook
 * support (or throws), every launch path that probes `supportsHooks()`
 * before installing would start writing into a config file that doesn't
 * exist for that engine.
