/**
 * GOLDEN — the sidebar's row-state vocabulary, locked.
 *
 * `sidebar-row-state.golden.txt` is the ground truth for what a sidebar row
 * shows in every state it can be in: the status glyph, its tone, whether the
 * row animates, and what the subtitle reads. The enumeration lives in
 * `sidebar-state-matrix.ts`; this file only pins its output.
 *
 * The point of a golden here rather than more prose assertions: the row view
 * is a PRIORITY LADDER (deletion > materializing job > activity word > branch)
 * whose rungs are individually reasonable and collectively easy to reorder by
 * accident. A hand-written case proves the rung its author was thinking about.
 * A committed table proves all of them at once — and turns any change into a
 * reviewable diff instead of a silent behavior shift.
 *
 * Locale is pinned to English on purpose: several subtitles come from `t()`,
 * so a golden captured under a different active language would be a different
 * document. The locale cell is process-wide, so this restores it afterwards.
 *
 * After an INTENTIONAL change:
 *     KOBE_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 bun run test:fast
 * then read the diff — every moved line should be one you meant to move.

/**
 * Every glyph the rail can render must survive the FONT, not just the layout.
 *
 * kobe reserves one cell per state glyph, and both the width table and opentui
 * agree on one cell for all of these. The terminal may not: when the user's
 * font lacks a codepoint, the OS substitutes another face at ITS advance, and
 * a CJK or dingbat substitute is 1.1–1.6 cells wide — it overruns into the
 * label beside it. Ambiguous-width codepoints hide this, because everyone in
 * the pipeline still calls them 1 cell.
 *
 * That shipped: `◌` U+25CC (the tab row's old "unknown" glyph) is absent from
 * FiraCode Nerd Font and SF Mono, so macOS drew it from HiraginoSans at 1.62
 * cells and it sat on the first letter of every tab name (2026-08-15). `✕`
 * U+2715 did the same at 1.24 cells via ZapfDingbats.
 *
 * So the vocabulary is an allowlist, and adding to it means checking the
 * candidate against the fonts people actually run first. The dingbat block
 * (U+2700–U+27BF) and the geometric shapes a Latin mono font typically skips
 * are what to avoid; Latin-1, ASCII, and the four filled/hollow circles are
 * present essentially everywhere.
