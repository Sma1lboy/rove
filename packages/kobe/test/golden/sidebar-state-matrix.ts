/**
 * The sidebar's state vocabulary, enumerated.
 *
 * `buildSidebarRowView` is the single place that decides what a sidebar row
 * SAYS: which status glyph it wears, which tone colours it, whether it
 * animates, and what its subtitle reads. Every one of those answers falls out
 * of a priority ladder — deletion outranks a materializing job, which outranks
 * a hook-driven activity word, which outranks the branch — and the ladder is
 * exactly the kind of thing that drifts one rung at a time under unrelated
 * fixes. Prose assertions catch the rung someone thought to write down.
 *
 * So this module renders the ladder's WHOLE input space to text instead. It
 * owns no assertions: it produces the canonical rows, and
 * `sidebar-row-state.test.ts` locks them against the committed golden.
 *
 * Keeping it separate from the test file is what lets the enumeration stay
 * exhaustive without the test file outgrowing the size cap, and it means the
 * matrix can be printed by hand (`bun test/golden/sidebar-state-matrix.ts`)
 * while investigating a diff.
