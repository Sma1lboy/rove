/**
 * Regression pin (2026-08-12, follow-up to issue #20): a live pty session the
 * persisted tab snapshot doesn't list must be ADOPTED into that snapshot, not
 * only reported.
 *
 * Reported-only was the state the owner hit on 0.8.77: three tasks had live
 * `claude` sessions the sidebar drew as `⚠` rows, and a row that is in no tab
 * state can't be opened, focused or closed — engines he could neither read
 * nor end. The pin drives the real TUI against a divergence built the way the
 * field one arose (the session outlives its snapshot entry) and asserts the
 * snapshot names the live tab again.
