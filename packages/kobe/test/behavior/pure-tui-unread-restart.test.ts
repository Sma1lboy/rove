/**
 * Regression pin for issue #22 (owner report 2026-08-12, wisp): a session you
 * have already read must not come back UNREAD after you quit kobe and start
 * it again.
 *
 * The bug is environment-shaped, which is why this test spends two real TUI
 * processes on it: the daemon's activity registry outlives the TUI, so the
 * second launch is handed the very same `turn_complete` — while the seen bit
 * that digests the lamp lived only in the first process's memory. Nothing
 * short of an actual restart against a live daemon reproduces it.
 *
 * Shape: complete a turn on tab-1, let launch #1 sit in that tab (reading
 * it), then make tab-2 the active tab so launch #2 opens somewhere else and
 * tab-1's row is one you are NOT looking at — exactly where the lamp shows.
