/**
 * The Inbox's state badges must occupy ONE cell each in the real frame.
 *
 * kobe budgets a single cell per state glyph everywhere it draws one, and
 * every layer in the pipeline agrees: `display-width.ts`, opentui's layout,
 * and the Unicode width tables all say 1. The terminal is the layer that can
 * disagree — when the user's font lacks a codepoint the OS substitutes another
 * face at ITS advance, and a CJK or dingbat or emoji substitute is 1.1–2.1
 * cells, overrunning the text beside it. Nothing upstream can see that; the
 * width table is not wrong, the font is just missing the glyph.
 *
 * This pane shipped `⌛` (U+231B) for rate-limited. U+231B carries the Unicode
 * Emoji property, so macOS resolved it to AppleColorEmoji at 2.13 cells — a
 * colour glyph in a monochrome pane, overflowing its column (2026-08-15, the
 * same sweep that removed the sidebar's oversized `◌` and `✕`).
 *
 * So the assertion is on the CELL, not on the character: mount the real pane,
 * capture the real frame, and require each badge to sit in one cell of the
 * grid. A glyph swapped for one the fonts lack would still pass a
 * `toBe("◷")`-style check — this is the shape that wouldn't.
 *
 * The sidebar's half of the same vocabulary is pinned separately, by the
 * font-verified allowlist in `test/golden/sidebar-row-state.test.ts`.
