/**
 * The tab auto-naming pass (`useTabNaming`), end to end for the engine whose
 * session id Rove cannot pin.
 *
 * Claude tabs carry a `--session-id` Rove chose at spawn, so the pass has
 * always had a session to read a first prompt from. Codex accepts no such
 * flag — its tabs had NO id, were skipped entirely, and wore `codex N`
 * forever. The one place codex does publish its thread id is its own OSC
 * title (it writes the id there until the thread is named), so the pass now
 * reads it back through the engine contract (`sessionIdFromTitle`) and names
 * the tab from that thread's rollout.
 *
 * Lives in the bun-run render track: the hook is a React effect, so it needs
 * a real renderer to mount against. ONE case on purpose — the pass runs on a
 * real 5s interval, so every extra case costs another 5s of wall clock, and
 * the negative side ("a title that is a NAME yields no session id") is a pure
 * rule already pinned in test/engine/terminal-title-placeholder.test.ts.
