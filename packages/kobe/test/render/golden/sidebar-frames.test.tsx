/**
 * GOLDEN — what the sidebar actually LOOKS LIKE, locked frame by frame.
 *
 * The pure state matrix (`test/golden/sidebar-row-state.golden.txt`) locks what
 * each row decides. This locks what the terminal receives: real
 * `@opentui/react` mount, real Yoga layout, real char grid — one committed
 * `.frame.txt` per state of the rail.
 *
 * Why both, rather than one or the other: the two fail differently. A glyph
 * regression that the state matrix would catch could still be invisible if the
 * row never renders; a layout regression (indent lost, right-edge cluster
 * pushed off the rail, a row that stopped appearing) never reaches the state
 * machine at all. Substring assertions — `expect(text).toContain("feat/a")` —
 * catch neither, because they say nothing about the cells they don't name.
 *
 * After an INTENTIONAL change:
 *     KOBE_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 bun run test:render
 * then read the diff. Every changed cell should be one you meant to change.
