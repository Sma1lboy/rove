/**
 * The sidebar scene catalog — every state of the rail worth locking a frame of.
 *
 * A scene is a fully-specified `SidebarTree` mount plus, optionally, the keys
 * to press before capturing. Keeping the catalog separate from the runner means
 * adding a state is a data edit, and the runner's compare logic never grows.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded from every scene: `kind: "main"` tasks. A project row
 * resolves its label by polling the repo's real git HEAD, so a frame containing
 * one would depend on the checkout the test happened to run against. That row's
 * own logic is locked exhaustively (and hermetically) by the pure state matrix
 * in `test/golden/sidebar-row-state.golden.txt` instead.
