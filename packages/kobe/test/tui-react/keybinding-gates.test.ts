/**
 * Pins the workspace-host gating contract (workspace/keybinding-gates.ts):
 * an open dialog or full-page swap disables every workspace chord group,
 * and the ONE deliberate exemption — the settings page's own close keys —
 * is live exactly while settings is open with no sub-dialog above it. One
 * named predicate per group, rather than inline `dialog.stack.length === 0 && …`
 * expressions scattered through host-keybindings.ts with nothing testing them.
