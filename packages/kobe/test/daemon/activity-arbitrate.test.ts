/**
 * The arbitration core (activity-arbitrate.ts) — herdr's multi-source model
 * pinned branch by branch. Every status source writes its own slot; this
 * pure function is the ONE place the priority order lives:
 *
 *   sticky hook > hook (unless a fresher observed rest corrects a stale
 *   hook running) > observed (fills holes / known-idle) > unknown.
 *
 * Registry-level parity (watchdogs, replay, wire payloads) is pinned by
 * activity-state / activity-liveness / activity-observer tests; this file
 * pins the arbitration rules themselves so a future source addition changes
 * ONE table of expectations.
