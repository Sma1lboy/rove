/**
 * file-watch-trigger (shared file-change trigger backing the ui-prefs,
 * keybindings, and pty-exit fan-outs). Why these tests matter: this module is
 * the load-bearing half of "edit a file on disk → daemon refreshes the
 * channel". The internals are a stat-poll (issue #61: macOS FSEvents arms
 * asynchronously and permanently drops writes landing in the arm window, so
 * fs-event watching — fs.watch or chokidar — cannot be lossless); the
 * EXTERNAL contract the callers depend on must be intact:
 *
 *   - it stamps by PATH, not inode, so the State Store's atomic tmp+rename
 *     is still seen (an inode watch goes dead after rename);
 *   - it filters by basename, so unrelated siblings in the dir don't trigger;
 *   - it debounces bursts into a single trigger;
 *   - `debounceMs <= 0` is a no-op (callers use it as the "watching disabled"
 *     switch);
 *   - `stop()` fully stops the poll — no further triggers, no leaked timers.
 *
 * These run against a real temp dir, with timeout-based assertions because
 * poll + debounce delivery is async. The old test surface lived in the
 * ui-prefs/keybindings watcher tests (also real-fs, kept green); this file
 * pins the shared primitive directly.
