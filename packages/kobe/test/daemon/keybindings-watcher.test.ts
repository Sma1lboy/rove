/**
 * keybindings watcher (KOB — live keybinding propagation). Sibling of the
 * ui-prefs watcher: the daemon half of "edit keybindings.yaml and every
 * pane re-applies it live". Load-bearing mechanics it must not regress:
 *
 *   - watch the settings DIRECTORY so an editor's tmp+rename (which swaps
 *     the inode) doesn't silently kill the watch;
 *   - bump a monotonic `rev` on every change — the daemon carries no keymap
 *     data, only the "re-read now" token, so it deliberately does NOT diff
 *     content (the TUI owns validation);
 *   - seed the bus last-value cache at start so a late subscriber learns the
 *     channel's current rev.
 *
 * Isolated via KOBE_HOME_DIR → a temp home (defaultKeybindingsPath honours
 * it). Writes are plain fs writes — the file is owned by the user/editor,
 * not the State Store.
