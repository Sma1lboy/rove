/**
 * Poke-until-observed — the fix for the whole fs-watcher test flake class.
 *
 * A watcher test that writes ONCE and then waits is really asserting two
 * things: that the watcher reacts, AND that it happened to be ready at the
 * instant of that single write. The second one is a race — chokidar's
 * initial scan, debounce coalescing, and fs-event delivery all stretch
 * under parallel-suite load, so such a test passes standalone and flakes in
 * full runs.
 *
 * Repeating the write removes the timing dependency entirely: keep poking
 * until the condition holds. Assertions must therefore be MONOTONIC
 * (`>= n`, "grew since"), never exact counts — the poke may legitimately
 * land more than once.
