/**
 * Daemon worktree-changes collector (issue #6) — the single `git status`
 * collector that replaces per-pane polling. What matters here:
 *
 *   - **Exclusions**: archived tasks and remote (`ssh://`) projects are
 *     never collected — the Archives view paying git-status for shelved
 *     worktrees was the original 30GB-repo freeze trigger, and a remote
 *     project's worktree isn't on this filesystem at all.
 *   - **Publish-on-change only**: a status pass that round-trips to the
 *     same counts publishes nothing — subscribed panes must not re-render
 *     rows on unchanged ticks (DESIGN §5.5, daemon side).
 *   - **Pruning**: a task deleted/archived between ticks drops its entry
 *     from the published map (with a republish), and a status run that
 *     completes AFTER its entry was pruned must not resurrect it.
 *   - **In-flight dedupe**: ticks landing while a worktree's status is
 *     still running start nothing — the guard that keeps a slow repo at
 *     one background child, not one per tick.
 *
 * The runner is injected (no real git / worktrees); the cadence floor is
 * zeroed so successive ticks are immediately eligible. The pure timing
 * math (adaptive cadence, hard backoff) is covered by the shared
 * poll-scheduling tests — this file pins the collector's pass logic.
