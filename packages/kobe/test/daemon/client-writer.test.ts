/**
 * Per-client socket write backpressure (fix E). The daemon is a single
 * long-lived writer fanning channel frames out to every subscribed socket;
 * `socket.write()` returning `false` (OS send buffer full for a slow client)
 * must not be ignored: Node then queues unbounded heap and the daemon grows
 * to GBs and OOMs. {@link ClientWriter} obeys backpressure per client: it pauses on
 * `false`, resumes on `'drain'`, bounds its queue (dropping the oldest
 * droppable frames), and NEVER drops a critical (lifecycle/response) frame nor
 * reorders a single client's stream.
