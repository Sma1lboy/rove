/**
 * Perf-budget regression net for the focus-switch hot path — OPERATION
 * COUNTS, never wall-clock (docs/HARNESS.md §Performance contracts).
 *
 * `setActiveTask` is the single most frequent user action in this multi-
 * session TUI (every task/focus switch), and all it needs is `updatedAt`
 * bumped so the sidebar's `recent` sort tracks focus order. Routing that
 * through `store.update(id, {})` with an EMPTY patch runs a full fsync'd
 * read-merge-write (`doSave`: flock + read + merge + `handle.sync()` +
 * rename) on EVERY switch — one fsync'd disk rewrite + one full-list
 * broadcast, all to move a field the DEFAULT sort never reads.
 *
 * The fix (`store.touchRecency`) bumps `updatedAt` in-cache + notifies
 * listeners (so `recent` still reorders LIVE) but flushes lazily on the next
 * real mutation — zero fsync on the focus path. This pins that budget:
 *
 *   - fsync'd disk rewrites over 10 setActive calls: 0 (was 10).
 *   - listeners STILL notified per switch (live `recent` reorders) → 10.
 *   - a later REAL mutation flushes the lazily-accumulated recency once → 1.
 *
 * `active-task` frames publishing per switch is a property of the daemon
 * handler (unchanged by this fix); it's pinned separately in
 * `test/daemon/set-active-frame.test.ts`.
 *
 * The disk-write count is observed at the SAME seam production writes: the
 * atomic `rename(tmpPath, tasks.json)` that completes a `doSave`. A regression
 * that puts a synchronous persist back on the focus path shows up as extra
 * renames to the manifest, which the UI would never reveal — exactly why a
 * counting test, not eyeballing, holds this line.
