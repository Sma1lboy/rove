/**
 * Home-ownership guard (prod 2026-08-13).
 *
 * A `dev:sandbox` daemon inherited `KOBE_DAEMON_SOCKET_PATH` from the task
 * terminal it was launched in. Because an explicit socket override outranks
 * `*_HOME_DIR`, it bound the PRODUCTION socket while serving its own — empty —
 * task index. Attached TUIs reconnected onto it, `hello` succeeded, and the
 * sidebar went blank ("No active tasks") with all 27 tasks intact on disk.
 *
 * Every other handshake check passed, because nothing was wrong with the
 * wire. What these lock is that a client refuses a daemon belonging to a
 * DIFFERENT home before adopting a single task from it.
