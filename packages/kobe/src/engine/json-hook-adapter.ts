/**
 * Abstract base for engine hook adapters whose engine uses the shared
 * settings.json hook shape (Claude Code's `~/.claude/settings.json`, Codex's
 * `~/.codex/hooks.json`). It owns EVERYTHING vendor-neutral: the best-effort
 * read→merge→write I/O and the four install/remove methods, all delegating to
 * the pure merge core in `./json-hooks`. A concrete adapter supplies only its
 * vendor id, its event→verb table ({@link eventMap}), and its settings path —
 * plus any vendor-specific override (Claude adds `error_type`/permission detail
 * decoding + the legacy `WorktreeCreate` cleanup).
 *
 * This is the seam the architecture promises: "adding a new engine = a new
 * adapter file." For a same-shape engine that file is ~3 members.
