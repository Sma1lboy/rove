/**
 * Terminal-title policy — the rules for reading an engine's OWN OSC 0/2
 * title, held apart from `registry.ts` so the rules never learn a vendor's
 * name (see the next paragraph — that is the seam, and the imports keep it
 * honest).
 *
 * Pure on purpose: every function here takes the engine's declared
 * {@link EngineTerminalTitle} rather than a vendor id, so `registry.ts` keeps
 * the one vendor→entry resolution (and its thin wrappers stay the import
 * site every neutral caller already uses) while the rules live here. Nothing
 * in this file names an engine — the vendor-specific KNOWLEDGE (which
 * glyphs, which identifier shape) is declared by the adapter that owns it.
 *
 * Three questions a neutral surface asks of a live title, in order:
 *   1. what is the NAME in it — {@link stripStatusPrefix} drops the engine's
 *      own status decoration, which Rove draws in its own glyph column;
 *   2. what does it say about the TURN — {@link titleTurnHint};
 *   3. is it a name at ALL — {@link titleIsPlaceholder} / {@link titleSessionId}.
 *
 * Question 3 exists because an engine's title is only as good as what the
 * engine has to put in it. Codex writes its thread UUID until the thread is
 * named, so a fresh codex tab reported `01a00ee9-f0e9-…` where claude and
 * kimi report a sentence. {@link EngineTerminalTitle.sessionIdFromTitle} is
 * how an engine says so — and, because that placeholder happens to be an id,
 * how it says what to name the tab instead. An engine whose bad title carries
 * NO id needs a sibling knob here; none does today, so none exists yet.
 */

/**
 * Native OSC 0/2 title policy for an engine's interactive sessions.
 * `ownsStatus` means the engine's live title is the status surface while it
 * is visible, so neutral tab chrome must not prefix a duplicate turn glyph.
 * `launchArgs` lets an adapter select the engine's own title fields without
 * teaching the launcher vendor-specific config syntax — the FIRST way to fix
 * a bad title is to ask the engine for a better one.
