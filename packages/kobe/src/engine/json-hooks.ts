/**
 * Shared JSON-hooks merge core (KOB) — the engine-neutral half of the hook
 * adapters.
 *
 * Claude Code (`~/.claude/settings.json`) and Codex (`~/.codex/hooks.json`)
 * happen to share the SAME hook file shape:
 *
 *   { "hooks": { "<Event>": [ { "matcher"?: string,
 *                               "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": … } ] } ] } }
 *
 * so the install/merge/remove mechanics (tag kobe's own groups, replace only
 * those, preserve the user's hooks + every other key, drop empties) are
 * identical. Only the EVENT→verb table differs per engine. This module owns the
 * mechanics; each adapter passes its own {@link HookEventSpec}[] and keeps the
 * vendor's event-name vocabulary. Pure (no I/O), so it's unit-tested directly.
