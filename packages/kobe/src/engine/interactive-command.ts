/**
 * Which interactive engine CLI to launch in a task's hosted PTY.
 *
 * The "middle" pane of a task session runs a vendor's *interactive* CLI
 * (the same binary a human would run in a terminal) — not the headless
 * path. The vendor → default-argv mapping itself lives on the engine
 * registry (`registry.ts` `defaultCommand`); this module layers the
 * user's per-vendor override on top. Every launch site (the outer
 * monitor's Handover, the Tasks-pane switch, `new-chattab`) goes
 * through this.
 *
 * Codex's bare `codex` (no subcommand) opens its interactive TUI, the
 * same way bare `claude` does — `codex exec` is the headless path we
 * deliberately don't use here.
 *
 * Per-vendor OVERRIDE: the launch command is configurable in
 * Settings → Engines, so a user whose binary isn't on PATH as `claude`
 * (e.g. it's `cl`) or who wants default flags (`claude --model …`) can
 * set their own. The override is a shell-ish command STRING persisted in
 * the shared `state.json` under {@link engineCommandKey}; we read it with
 * the cross-process {@link getPersistedString} (the Tasks-pane and
 * `new-chattab` run in their own processes, so they can't share the TUI's
 * reactive KV — they all read the same file instead). Empty / unset →
 * the built-in default.
