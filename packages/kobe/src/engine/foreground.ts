/**
 * Foreground-process identity for a terminal tab — "what engine is

 * tree instead of the OSC window title.
 *
 * The title was the old signal (`vendorFromTerminalTitle`) and it is
 * structurally wrong: an engine's title is free-form activity text it
 * writes for HUMANS ("✳ Claude Code" at launch, then a summary of what
 * it's doing), so a claude session whose summary happened to mention
 * "codex" identified as codex — a substring collision, not an identity.
 *
 * A process tree can't collide like that: we walk the PTY shell's
 * descendants and ask each one's ARGV[0] (the executable, never its
 * arguments) whether it is a registered engine binary. That also sees
 * through user wrappers — `claudecpa` is a zsh function running
 * `cc-switch start claude …`, whose own argv[0] is `cc-switch`, but its
 * child is the real `claude.exe`, and the walk keeps going.
