/**
 * Engine registry — the ONE place per-vendor wiring lives.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md "Engine-owned UI data": neutral layers (monitor, orchestrator,
 * TUI) must not hard-code vendor strings or pick vendor-specific readers
 * with inline if-ladders. Instead they call {@link engineEntry} with the
 * task's `vendor` and use whatever the entry exposes:
 *
 *   - `history`        — transcript store reader (auto-title, recap).
 *   - `detectAccount`  — read-only login/binary probe (Settings → Accounts).
 *   - `createHookAdapter` — activity-hook installer (claude + codex today).
 *   - `createTurnDetector` — ChatTab turn-completion detection.
 *   - `defaultCommand` / `displayName` — launch + label defaults.
 *
 * Adding an engine = one new entry here (plus its vendor-local modules);
 * removing the vendor if-ladders from neutral code was the point (KOB).
 *
 * Custom (user-registered) engines get {@link customEngineEntry}: an
 * explicit, documented EMPTY entry — no transcript store (auto-title keeps
 * the placeholder rather than mis-reading another vendor's files), no
 * account detection, no hooks, and a `defaultCommand` of the
 * bare id (the real launch command lives in the user's
 * `engineCommand.<id>` override; see `interactive-command.ts`). This
 * preserves the pre-registry behavior for unknown vendor ids exactly.
 *
 * Must stay importable from vitest and MUST NOT import from `src/tui/`.
