/**
 * `AgentTurn` — the engine-owned per-turn attribution record.
 *
 * One record per completed agent turn: which model ran, how long it took,
 * what it cost in tokens. The engine adapter is the ONLY thing that knows
 * how to produce one, because the facts live in the vendor's own transcript
 * (claude's JSONL `message.model` + `message.usage`, codex's rollout, …).
 * Neutral layers (daemon, TUI, web) store and render this shape and never
 * parse a vendor file themselves — CLAUDE.md "Engine-owned UI data".
 *
 * `taskId` / `tabId` are deliberately NOT here: a turn is a fact about an
 * engine session, and the engine has no idea what a Rove task is. The daemon
 * joins the two when it records the turn (`agent-turns-store.ts`).
 *
 * Pure data + a pure reader contract; the reader is exposed on the engine
 * registry entry as `readTurns`, so adding a vendor is one adapter file.
