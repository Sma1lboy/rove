/**
 * Engine PRESETS and the command → protocol resolution behind them.
 *
 * The dispatch face (`rove api add` / `send --tab new`) takes a raw
 * `--command`, never a vendor: what an engine IS at launch is a command
 * line, and the protocol kobe speaks to it (which history reader, which
 * trust store, whether the first message may ride argv) is DERIVED from
 * that command rather than declared alongside it.
 *
 * Resolution is three-tiered — this module owns tier (a), the
 * deterministic one:
 *   a) `argv[0]` names a built-in binary or a registered preset ⇒ that
 *      preset's protocol. The main path, and the only one that answers
 *      before the process exists.
 *   b) post-launch sniffing (`./protocol-sniff.ts`) upgrades a session
 *      that tier (a) could not name.
 *   c) neither answers ⇒ {@link GENERIC_PROTOCOL}, which resolves to the
 *      registry's empty custom entry: no transcript reader, no hooks,
 *      silence-window liveness and settle-paste delivery.
 *
 * A CUSTOM engine is a NAMED PRESET: an id in `customEngineIds`, its
 * command in `engineCommand.<id>`, its display name in `engineName.<id>`,
 * and — new here — the protocol it speaks in `engineProtocol.<id>`,
 * declared once at registration so every later dispatch is deterministic
 * instead of re-sniffed. A preset registered before this key existed reads
 * as generic until its protocol is set.
 *
 * State-reading by construction, which is why it is NOT in `registry.ts`
 * (that module stays state-free so vitest and the daemon can import it).
