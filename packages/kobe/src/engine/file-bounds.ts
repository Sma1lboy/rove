 * Defensive bounds for reading vendor-owned transcript / credential files.
 *
 * The engine readers (`claude-code-local`, `codex-local`, `copilot-local`
 * history; `account-detect`) load whole on-disk JSONL transcripts and JSON
 * credential files that kobe does not control. A corrupt or pathological file
 * — a multi-GB rollout, a single mega-line — could OOM or hang the TUI/daemon
 * if read and `JSON.parse`d unbounded. These helpers add cheap, best-effort
 * ceilings: stat the file before slurping it, and skip a line that's too long
 * to be real before handing it to `JSON.parse`.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort and non-throwing into the degraded path:
 * oversize → an empty result (the same shape callers already produce for a
 * missing/empty file), never a crash, never a leak of file contents.
