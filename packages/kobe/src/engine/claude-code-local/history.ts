/**
 * Read historical messages from Claude Code's on-disk JSONL.
 *
 * Algorithm ported from `refs/opcode/src-tauri/src/commands/claude.rs`
 * lines 147–230 (cwd-from-first-10-lines fallback) and lines 183–191
 * (lossy slash↔dash decoding).
 *
 * Where Claude Code keeps sessions on disk:
 *
 *     ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<sessionId>.jsonl
 *
 * `<encoded-cwd>` is the *absolute* cwd with every non-alphanumeric
 * character replaced by `-` (see {@link encodeCwd}), e.g.
 * `/Users/jackson/i/kobe` → `-Users-jackson-i-kobe`. The encoding is
 * **lossy**: a path containing literal `-` collapses to the same
 * directory as a `/`-delimited one (so `foo/bar-baz` and `foo-bar/baz`
 * collide). For session reads we don't need to reverse the encoding —
 * we just iterate every project dir and look for the matching
 * `<sessionId>.jsonl`. That's what opcode does too (the
 * `decode_project_path` helper is documented as deprecated).
 *
 * Each JSONL line is a record like:
 *
 *     { "type": "user", "message": { "role": "user", "content": "..." },
 *       "timestamp": "2026-05-09T03:59:51.343Z",
 *       "sessionId": "<uuid>", "cwd": "/Users/...", ... }
 *
 * The shapes vary — Claude Code persists not just messages but also
 * permission-mode events, file-history snapshots, etc. We filter to
 * records that carry a recognisable role+content pair, so the
 * orchestrator's chat pane only sees actual conversation.
 *
 * On-disk `content` is sometimes a bare string and sometimes a Claude
 * content-block array. We normalize both shapes through
 * {@link normalizeClaudeContent} and surface the vendor-neutral
 * `Message.blocks` union (see src/types/content.ts).

 * kobe itself, holding orphaned prompts Claude's `--resume` never read.

/**
 * Append (or merge into) the session JSONL a synthetic user record so
 * an interrupted `claude -p` turn isn't lost to the model on the next
 * `--resume`.
 *
 * Background — `claude -p` writes records to disk only at well-defined
 * turn boundaries; if we SIGTERM/SIGKILL the subprocess before it
 * reaches one (which is exactly what a steer or ESC interrupt does),
 * the user message it was processing is never persisted. The next
 * `--resume <sid>` then reads a JSONL that's missing the abandoned
 * prompt, so the model is blind to whatever the user had been saying.
 * The fix is to rescue the prompt into the JSONL ourselves on stop.
 *
 * Append-only — this never rewrites the file. Scan backwards for the
 * most recent conversational (user/assistant) record to decide how to
 * chain the new record:
 *   - assistant record (or empty file): append a fresh user record
 *     chained to it (`parentUuid` = that record's `uuid`).
 *   - user record (an earlier kill that already rescued a prompt, with
 *     no assistant reply since): coalesce — carry that turn's text
 *     forward into the new record and chain to its PARENT, superseding
 *     it as a same-parent sibling. claude's `--resume` walker follows
 *     the newest leaf, so the model sees ONE coalesced user turn (never
 *     two back-to-back user records — a shape the API rejects), and the
 *     older sibling is left on disk untouched.
 *
 * Why append-only: the engine is mid-stop when this runs and claude may
 * still be flushing buffered records to the same JSONL. The previous
 * read-all-then-`writeFile`-the-whole-file merge clobbered any record
 * flushed after our read snapshot. `appendFile` (O_APPEND) writes at the
 * live EOF, so concurrent flushes survive; a stale snapshot can only
 * mis-chain `parentUuid`, never lose data.
 *
 * File-not-exists is tolerated: claude may have died before its very
 * first record landed; we create the parent directory and write the
 * record as the first line. Any other I/O error surfaces to the
 * caller (engine.stop logs + swallows so the steer flow doesn't
 * hard-fail on a permissions hiccup).
 *
 * Schema — minimum keys needed for {@link readHistory}'s parser AND
 * for claude's own `--resume` reader to recognise it:
 *
 *     { type: "user", message: { role: "user", content: <text> },
 *       uuid, parentUuid, sessionId, cwd, timestamp,
 *       isSidechain: false, userType: "external", version: "1.0.0" }
 *
 * `parentUuid` chains the record to the prior turn so claude's resume
 * walker doesn't see it as an orphan. `uuid` is a fresh v4.
