/**
 * Claude Code hook adapter (KOB) — the first real {@link EngineHookAdapter}.
 *
 * Writes kobe's hooks into the user's GLOBAL `~/.claude/settings.json`, so a
 * single install makes EVERY Claude Code session report normalized activity
 * events back to kobe via `kobe hook <verb>`. The hook carries no task id; it
 * reports its `cwd` and the daemon maps that to a task by worktree path (see
 * `daemon/cwd-task.ts`). The read/merge/write I/O and the install/remove
 * methods live in the shared {@link JsonHookAdapter} base; this file adds only
 * what's Claude-specific: the hook event NAMES, the `error_type`/permission
 * detail decoding, and the legacy `WorktreeCreate` cleanup.
 *
 * Why global, not per-worktree: per-task hooks (written into each worktree's
 * `.claude/settings.local.json`) had to be installed at the right moment, only
 * fired after entering a task, didn't reach an already-running engine, and
 * leaked into a project's real repo root. One global block sidesteps all of
 * that and lights up every existing task at once. The cost — kobe's `kobe hook`
 * runs on every Claude session machine-wide — is cheap: it no-ops fast (and
 * never spawns the daemon) when the cwd isn't a kobe task.
 *
 * Don't clobber user hooks: this targets a SHARED file, so each merge tags its
 * own entries (by the kobe command substring) and replaces only those; the
 * user's own hooks for the same events are preserved.
