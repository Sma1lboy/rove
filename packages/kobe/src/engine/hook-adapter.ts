/**
 * Engine HOOK adapter — the neutral seam (KOB).
 *
 * kobe wants engine activity (turn started/finished, rate-limited, waiting on
 * a permission prompt) to flow as real events, not polling. Each engine
 * delivers that through its OWN hook mechanism — Claude Code's
 * `.claude/settings.json` hooks, Codex's `hooks.json`, etc. — which are
 * vendor-specific. This interface hides ALL of that behind a neutral contract
 * so the orchestrator / daemon / TUI never name a vendor (CLAUDE.md
 * "Engine-owned UI data"): the orchestrator just asks the adapter to install
 * the GLOBAL activity hooks once, and the adapter writes whatever its engine
 * reads, pointing each hook at `kobe hook <normalized-verb>` (see
 * {@link ./hook-events}). The hook reports its `cwd`; the daemon maps that to a
 * task (`daemon/cwd-task.ts`). Adding a new engine = a new adapter file; no
 * neutral code changes.
 *
 * Claude + Codex are real implementations (both use the same settings.json hook
 * shape, shared in `./json-hooks`); Copilot is a stub until its hook format is
 * wired (the interface is what keeps that change local).
