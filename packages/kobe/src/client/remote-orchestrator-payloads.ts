 * types/functions, moved verbatim, re-exported from `remote-orchestrator.ts`
 * so existing importers (tests, `deserializeTask` callers) keep their path.
 *
 * Also defines {@link OrchestratorSignals} — the explicit "deps bag" of
 * accessor/setter closures `handleOrchestratorEvent`
 * (`remote-orchestrator-events.ts`) and `performInit`
 * (`remote-orchestrator-connect.ts`) operate on, instead of closing over
