 * (`spawnDaemon`) may spawn
 * the daemon via `ensureReachable`; a pane only retries the existing socket
 * so helper panes never defeat daemon lazy-shutdown. Failures stay silent in
 * the UI with the caller-supplied bounded forensic logging policy.
 *
 * Retrying assumes the next attempt could differ from this one. Exactly one
 * failure breaks that assumption: this process is running from an install
 * that has been deleted, so `ensureReachable` cannot resolve an entry point
 * to re-exec and fails identically forever. The loop gives up there and
 * reports it once, via `onFatal`. Giving up is the SAFE direction — a client
 * that cannot spawn is not a reason to keep pressure on a healthy daemon,
 * and the remedy is reinstalling, which no amount of waiting performs.
