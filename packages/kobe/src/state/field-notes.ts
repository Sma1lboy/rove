/**
 * Read side of the durable field-note store (docs/design/dispatcher.md).
 * The DAEMON is the only writer (`kobe-daemon/src/daemon/notes-store.ts`);
 * this module is the launch path's reader, so a fresh worktree session can be
 * born knowing what previous sessions on the repo already paid to learn.
 *
 * Sync on purpose: `buildEngineSessionLaunch` is synchronous, and this is the
 * same shape as `repo-init.ts` reading `.rove/init-prompt.md` off disk at
 * launch. A missing/corrupt store is simply "no notes" — a knowledge feature
 * must never be able to block a session from starting.
 *
 * Matching is by `repoRoot`, not by re-deriving the store's git-common-dir
 * key: the daemon writes each record's `repoRoot` as the repo's main
 * worktree, and a task's `repo` field is already that same source root.
