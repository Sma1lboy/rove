/**
 * Issue-chat grammar — framework-free placement + first-prompt builders for
 * starting an engine session from a kanban story. Mirrors the web board's
 * quick-start contract (kobe-web/src/lib/issues.ts): the prompt frames the
 * story, and the agent reports completion through the daemon-owned issue API
 * (`issue-set-status`), never by editing repo files.
 *
 * Placements say WHERE the session runs — jump-or-stay is the drawer's
 * separate toggle (`IssueChatStart.jump`), supported by all three:
 *   - `worktree`        — a new worktree task with its own workspace.
 *   - `projectWorktree` — same task creation (worktree + branch + link),
 *                         but the session ALSO appears as a chattab in the
 *                         PROJECT workspace (a viewport tab —
 *                         `EngineTab.ptyTask`): isolated work, presented
 *                         where the project lives.
 *   - `project`         — no worktree: a new chattab on the repo's
 *                         main-task checkout (`task.ensureMain`).
