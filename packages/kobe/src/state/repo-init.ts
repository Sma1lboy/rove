/**
 * Resolve a repo's per-worktree init script + first prompt.
 *
 * Two sources, resolved PER FIELD with the in-repo files taking priority:
 *
 *   1. In-repo convention files, checked out in the worktree:
 *        <worktree>/.rove/init.sh         → runs before the engine starts
 *        <worktree>/.rove/init-prompt.md  → pasted as the engine's first prompt
 *      The legacy `.kobe/` spellings remain field-by-field fallbacks.
 *      These are version-controlled, so they're the project's authoritative
 *      setup and WIN when present.
 *   2. Per-user state.json override (`rove repo set …`) — a fallback default
 *      for a repo that doesn't ship its own convention files. Keyed by git
 *      toplevel, so it applies to every worktree of the repo.
 *
 * The init script runs in the worktree cwd, in the SAME shell that execs
 * the engine, so `export`s reach the engine. It runs once per worktree
 * (a marker under `<home>/.rove/` gates re-runs — see env.ts). The init
 * prompt is delivered only when a session is freshly created, never on
 * re-attach.
