/**
 * Chat tab strip visibility preference (Settings → General → Terminal).
 *
 * Three modes rather than a pair of booleans, because the states are
 * mutually exclusive and a `hidden + hideSingle` combination has no meaning:
 *
 *   - `always`      — the strip renders for every tab count, even a single
 *                     tab (whose row still carries the engine title and turn
 *                     chip). The default (owner call 2026-08-29, restoring
 *                     the pre-tree behaviour).
 *   - `multipleOnly`— hide the strip while a task has only one tab.
 *   - `never`       — no strip at all: the sidebar tree lists every
 *                     worktree's tabs as rows, so the horizontal strip is a
 *                     second copy of the same list (owner call 2026-08-01).
 *
 * kv-persisted; read live by `tui-react/workspace/TerminalTabs.tsx`.
