/**
 * Global worktree base-path override.
 *
 * By default Rove stores every LOCAL task worktree under
 * `<home>/.rove/worktrees/<repo-key>/<slug>` (see
 * `orchestrator/worktree/paths.ts`). This module owns the one optional
 * knob that relocates that `<home>/.rove/worktrees` root to a
 * user-chosen directory — e.g. a faster disk, or a folder the user
 * already keeps their scratch checkouts in. The per-repo `<repo-key>`
 * namespacing below it is preserved, so worktrees from different repos
 * never collide under a shared base.
 *
 * The value may start with the `$project_dir` token, which expands to
 * the task's project root at path-computation time — one global setting
 * that yields a per-project layout (e.g. `$project_dir/../` puts the
 * worktrees root next to each project). The token is only recognized as
 * the leading path segment; anywhere else it is a literal directory name.
 *
 * Stored in the shared state.json (the Settings dialog's KV writes the
 * same file) and read FRESH on every worktree-path computation, so
 * changing it takes effect for the next task with no daemon restart.
 * Only NEW tasks move: existing tasks keep their persisted worktreePath,
 * and the earlier default root stays recognized for listing/slug allocation
 * (see `managedWorktreeRootsFor`).
 *
 * Remote (SSH) projects are unaffected — their worktrees live on the
 * remote host under the project's own `basePath` (`remoteWorktreeRootFor`).
