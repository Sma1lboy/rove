/**
 * `lastActive` — THE unified word for "what was focused last".
 * One global record of the last active task id,
 * persisted through `state/store.ts`'s read-merge-write transaction:
 * whichever process writes last wins, deliberately WITHOUT multi-TUI
 * coordination — opening kobe lands on whatever was focused most
 * recently, anywhere. The repo/project follows from the task itself.
 *
 * Written by `Orchestrator.setActiveTask` on every focus change; read
 * once at orchestrator construction to seed the active-task signal, so a
 * daemon restart (or a fresh `kobe`) restores the last focus instead of
 * falling back to "first task in the list".
