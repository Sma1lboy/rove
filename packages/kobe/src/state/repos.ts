/**
 * Saved-repos persistence.
 *
 * The TUI's `KV` store (src/tui/context/kv.tsx) is a Solid-context wrapper
 * around `~/.config/rove/state.json`. Outside that context — e.g. from the
 * `kobe add` CLI subcommand — we can't use it. This module is the
 * non-reactive direct accessor for the same on-disk blob: load, mutate,
 * atomic-rename save.
 *
 * The file format is shared with the TUI KV: a flat JSON object whose
 * `savedRepos` key is a `string[]` of repo paths the user has explicitly
 * added. The TUI reads it via `kv.get("savedRepos", [])`; this module
 * reads/writes the same key directly.
 *
 * Concurrency note: all writes go through `src/state/store.ts`, whose
 * read-merge-write transactions keep concurrent writers (the TUI's
 * debounced flush, other panes' `setPersisted*` calls, a `kobe add` from
 * another shell) from erasing each other's keys. A running TUI's
 * in-memory cache still won't reflect an external addition until restart
 * — acceptable; there's deliberately no file watching.
