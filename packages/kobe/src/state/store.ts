/**
 * Single owner of `~/.config/rove/state.json` I/O.
 *
 * This file exists to kill a dual-writer hazard: with several kobe
 * processes alive at once, any writer that flushes a whole in-memory
 * snapshot clobbers keys another process wrote since that snapshot was
 * taken (the classic lost update). Every write therefore goes through
 * the read-merge-write transaction here.
 *
 * The fix is read-merge-write: every write re-reads the file fresh and
 * applies ONLY the keys the caller actually changed, then writes the
 * merged result atomically (tmp + rename, same crash-safety as before).
 * Concurrent writers touching DIFFERENT keys can no longer erase each
 * other; same-key writers remain last-write-wins, which is the documented
 * pre-existing semantics. There is still no flock — the merge shrinks the
 * race window to the read→rename span of a sync call, it does not
 * serialize writers. A true cross-process lock is the multi-instance
 * follow-up if same-key contention ever becomes real.
 *
 * Corrupt-file policy (aligned with orchestrator/index/store.ts's tasks.json
 * handling): a missing state.json reads as `{}` silently — that's the normal
 * fresh-machine case. Unparseable JSON is different: the bad file is renamed
 * to `state.json.corrupt-<ts>` (never deleted — a forensic copy survives) and
 * a warning goes to stderr once, then `{}` is returned so the UI/CLI is never
 * blocked. Either way the caller always gets `{}`, never a throw.
 *
 * tmp-write uniqueness: `writeStateFile` targets `${path}.<pid>.<nonce>.tmp`,
 * not a fixed shared name. Every write here still goes through the
 * read-merge-write of `patchStateFile`/`updateStateFile` above, but nothing
 * stops two DIFFERENT processes from calling `writeStateFile` at genuinely
 * the same instant (no flock, per the module's opening paragraph) — a shared
 * tmp path would let one process's `writeFileSync` interleave with another's
 * on the same inode and rename over a torn write. Per-process-unique tmp
 * names make that impossible; the final `rename()` stays atomic and
 * last-write-wins, unchanged.
