 * PTY Host prompt delivery for `kobe api`. The standalone `kobe pty-host`

 * reuses the canonical engine key or creates it from the shared launch spec.

 * pty.* frames are served by the pty-host on its OWN socket (NOT proxied
 * through the daemon — see `kobe-daemon/daemon/pty-server.ts`), so this
 * module opens its own short-lived client to `defaultPtyHostSocketPath()`,
 * exactly like the `pty-list` verb does. Nothing here is engine-specific:
 * the engine key is found by the DETERMINISTIC `<taskId>::tab-1` the TUI
 * always assigns its first (engine) tab, refined by an argv match against
 * the vendor's own launch binary — never a hard-coded "claude"/"codex".
