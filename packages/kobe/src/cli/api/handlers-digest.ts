/**
 * `digest` — the RULER. An aggregate read over state Rove already persists:
 * tasks touched in the window and routine run outcomes
 * (`AutomationRun.status`). No new data model, no new writer.
 *
 * Why it exists: Rove runs a lot of unattended agent work (fan-out, routines,
 * the dispatcher) and had no way to answer "is this week better than last
 * week". Every self-improvement mechanism is astrology without a measurement
 * it can move, so the ruler ships before anything that claims to learn.
 *
 * Task OUTCOMES are deliberately absent: completion flows back to the
 * spawning agent's chat tab (`send`), not into Rove state — the stored
 * `workerReport` channel was removed because nothing read it.
