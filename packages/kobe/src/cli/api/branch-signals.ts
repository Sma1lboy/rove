/**
 * Committed-work signals for `collect`: how far a task branch has moved
 * from its base. `readWorktreeChanges` only counts UNCOMMITTED files, so a
 * task that commits its work reads `+0 −0` — exactly when the caller is
 * choosing a fan-out winner. These helpers add the committed side:
 * ahead-of-base commit count and a diffstat vs the merge-base.
 *
 * The base ref comes from the TASK RECORD first: `add --base-branch` is
 * persisted on the task at create time, so a task cut from `release/2.x`
 * is measured against `release/2.x`, not against a guess. Records that
 * predate the field (or whose recorded ref no longer resolves) fall back
 * to the re-resolution the worktrees page uses: `origin/HEAD` →
 * `origin/main` → `origin/master` → local `main`/`master`. All reads are
 * lock-free (`GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`) and best-effort — a repo with no
 * resolvable base yields nulls, never an error.
