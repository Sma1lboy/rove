/**
 * The engine face of `kobe api`: `engine-list` (what can I launch, and with
 * what command?) and `set-command` (pin a task's launch command).
 *
 * These are the two halves of the dispatch contract. `engine-list` is
 * WYSIWYG on purpose — it prints each entry's raw command line so an agent
 * can copy one, edit a flag, and pass the result straight back as
 * `--command`, without kobe modelling anyone's flags. `set-command` is the
 * write twin: it resolves the command's protocol here (the preset registry
 * lives in kobe's state.json, which the daemon cannot read) and sends both.
 *
 * Spec + handler live together (the PANE_VERB pattern) so `verbs.ts` stays
 * under the file-size cap.
