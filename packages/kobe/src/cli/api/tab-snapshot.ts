/**
 * Publish a tab snapshot for a session the CLI started.
 *
 * The sidebar tree renders a worktree's tabs by reading the task's
 * `terminalTabs.<taskId>` snapshot (see `tui-react/workspace/
 * terminal-tabs-shared.ts`). That snapshot was only ever written by a MOUNTED
 * `TerminalTabs` — so a task started headlessly (`kobe api add --prompt`,
 * `kobe api send`, a routine firing) ran a perfectly live engine that the
 * tree could not see: `knownTaskTabs` returned null and the worktree row got
 * no children at all. Since headless start is how agent-driven work enters
 * kobe, that was most of the fleet rendering as empty worktrees.
 *
 * Same fix the issue-chat background spawn already applies
 * (`tui/workspace/issue-chat-spawn.ts` — "persist so a visit attaches, not
 * respawns"); this is that precedent applied to the CLI's own launch path.
 *
 * Deliberately WRITE-ONCE: it seeds the first engine tab for a task with no
 * snapshot and never touches an existing one. A mounted TUI owns tab state
 * for real (ordinals, titles, splits, closes), and a CLI process must not
 * fight it — `kobe api send` into a task you have open in the TUI reuses that
 * session, so overwriting here would clobber live state with a one-tab stub.
