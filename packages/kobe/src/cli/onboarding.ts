/**
 * First-run onboarding — the framework-free half.
 *
 * A bare `kobe` on a TTY runs the inline wizard once
 * (`src/tui-react/onboarding/host.tsx` collects the answers), then this
 * module APPLIES them after the renderer is torn down: hook shell
 * completions into the user's rc file, optionally run the agent-skill
 * installer (npx, inherits the terminal), print the ready banner, and
 * persist the `onboarded` flag so it never runs again. Every install is
 * re-runnable later (`kobe completions --help`, `kobe skill install`), so
 * declining is always safe.
