 * Some features spawn a CLI subcommand in a child process. In a packaged
 * install that is the active `rove` or `kobe` name on PATH; in dev there is
 * no installed bin, so we reconstruct the
 * exact runtime the dev script uses.
 *
 * Lives in `cli/` because it is about locating the public wrapper.

 * The `browser` export condition is required — opentui resolves a
