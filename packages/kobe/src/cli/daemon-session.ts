/**
 * Daemon session boilerplate for short-lived CLI processes.
 *
 * Every `kobe <cmd>` invocation that talks to the daemon repeats the same
 * three steps: connect (auto-starting the daemon when allowed), do the
 * work, close the socket on the way out — success OR error. This module
 * owns that lifecycle in one place so a command never leaks a socket and
 * never re-implements the connect/cleanup dance.
 *
 * Today's consumer is `api-cmd.ts`; `daemon-cmd.ts` / `hook-cmd.ts` keep
 * their hand-rolled equivalents for now (see the follow-up in the session
 * notes) — the `mode` option below already covers both of their patterns:
 *
 *   - `"start"` (default): connect, spawning the daemon if absent — the
 *     `connectOrStartDaemon` path `kobe api` uses.
 *   - `"require-running"`: connect ONLY to an already-live daemon, never
 *     spawn one — the `connectIfRunning` contract `kobe hook` relies on
 *     (a git hook must not boot a daemon as a side effect). Resolves
 *     `null` instead of throwing when no daemon answers.
