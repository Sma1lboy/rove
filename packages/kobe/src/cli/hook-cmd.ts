/**
 * `kobe hook <verb>` — INTERNAL subcommand fired by an engine's hooks (e.g.
 * Claude Code's Stop / StopFailure / Notification), installed GLOBALLY into the
 * user's `~/.claude/settings.json` by the engine hook adapter. It reports a
 * NORMALIZED activity event to the daemon, which maps the hook's cwd to a task
 * (`daemon/cwd-task.ts`), folds it into that task's transient engine-state, and
 * broadcasts it (event-driven task badges).
 *
 * Contract (load-bearing):
 *  - **Never spawns the daemon.** A hook may fire while the user is detached
 *    (no gui) and the daemon has idle-stopped; resurrecting a gui-less daemon
 *    would break the refcounted lazy-shutdown. If no daemon is running the
 *    event is simply dropped (best-effort; the activity badge lapses to idle
 *    and the polling fallback still covers it).
 *  - **Always exits 0.** A non-zero hook exit is at best logged and at worst
 *    (WorktreeCreate) FAILS the engine's action — never acceptable for an
 *    observability hook. Every failure path here is swallowed.
 *
 * `verb` is already vendor-neutral (the engine adapter did the translation);
 * extra detail (failure class, waiting reason) is read from the hook's stdin
 * JSON payload.

 *     global (a task's badge must light up wherever its engine runs).
 *  2. **Worktree-watch hook** — a global `PostToolUse` (Bash) observer that
 *     adopts a worktree as a task the MOMENT a `git worktree add` runs in any
 *     session, so it shows in the sidebar WITHOUT a running engine (the
 *     creation-time complement to the `session-start` auto-adopt below). This is
 *     a pure OBSERVER fired AFTER the tool, NOT a provider hook — see (3) for why
 *     that distinction is load-bearing.
 *  3. **WorktreeCreate cleanup** — earlier kobe (0.7.4–0.7.9) installed a global
 *     `WorktreeCreate` hook for external-worktree sync. That was WRONG:
 *     `WorktreeCreate` is a VCS *provider* hook — its mere presence makes Claude
 *     Code delegate worktree creation to it and skip the native git path, so
 *     kobe's observer hook (which returns no path) BROKE `claude --worktree` /
 *     `EnterWorktree` in every repo. We now remove any such hook we ever wrote.
 *     Creation-time sync is reborn via the `PostToolUse` hook in (2) — safe
 *     because `PostToolUse` only observes, it never provides; plus the daemon's
 *     `session-start` auto-adopt (`daemon/cwd-task.ts` `findAdoptableWorktree`)
 *     still catches worktrees first entered by an engine session.
