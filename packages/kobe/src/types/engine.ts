/**
 * Engine-derived data types (v0.6).
 *
 * v0.5 had a full `AIEngine` port (spawn/resume/stream/...) that the
 * orchestrator drove. Kobe now launches interactive engine CLIs through
 * Hosted PTYs and lets each engine own its conversation lifecycle. Engine
 * adapters expose history, identity, launch, capabilities, and telemetry.
 *
 * What lives here now:
 *   - `Message` / `EngineHistory` / `EngineUsageSnapshot` — the
 *     vendor-neutral shape that `engine/claude-code-local/history.ts`
 *     and `engine/codex-local/history.ts` normalize their on-disk
 *     JSONL into. Renderers downstream consume these, not the raw
 *     vendor records.
 *   - `ContentBlock` re-export — kept here as the canonical engine-type
 *     boundary; the actual taxonomy is owned by `types/content.ts`.
 *
 * What's gone (vs v0.5): `AIEngine`, `EngineEvent`, `SessionHandle`,
 * `SpawnOpts`, all UserInput / ApprovePlan / AskUserQuestion shapes,
 * `OrchestratorEvent`, command-discovery surfaces.
 * If a 0.6.x feature needs any of that, restore it deliberately —
 * don't drag the whole port back.
 *
 * Shared engine-capability types: `ModelChoice` / `ModelEffortLevel` /
 * `EngineCapabilities` / `EngineIdentity` / `PermissionMode` — the
 * composer's model picker + permission-mode cycle consume these
 * through the engine registry (engine-owned UI data, CLAUDE.md).
