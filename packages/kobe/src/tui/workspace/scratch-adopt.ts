/**
 * Scratch-task adoption decision (issues #33/#40) — pure. A scratch shell
 * earns a project home when TWO facts line up: its live cwd resolved to a
 * git repo, and a coding harness is confirmed running in it (the foreground
 * walk's verdict — the same confidence bar the tab identity uses; a mere
 * `cd` into a repo is browsing, not working).
 *
 * Once that bar is met, the decision de-dupes against tasks that already
 * exist (issue #40 — migrating a shell parked in the kobe main checkout
 * used to mint a second sidebar row for the same directory):
 *
 *   1. cwd equal to or inside a MANAGED task's worktree → FOLD the shell
 *      into that task as a new terminal tab. Checked first because
 *      `resolveMainRepoRoot` maps a linked worktree to the MAIN checkout —
 *      the repo-root match below would misfold into the main task.
 *   2. cwd equal to a main/dir task's directory — or the repo root the
 *      adopt would pin equal to one (a shell in a SUBDIR of the main
 *      checkout adopts the root, which is the same duplicate) → FOLD.
 *      Main rows win over dir rows: the canonical project row absorbs.
 *   3. No owner: cwd inside a KNOWN repo → migrate the row into that
 *      project group, silently. An UNFAMILIAR repo → migrate + surface the
 *      save-as-project hint (about the savedRepos registry, not the move).
 *   4. No repo semantics, or no live harness → stay in Scratch.
 *
 * The caller supplies already-resolved, canonicalized facts; this module
 * only decides.
