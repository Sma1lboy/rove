 * Pure "what should this tab's turn detector track" resolution, kept apart

 * hand-kept copies. Framework-free: no signals, no React state, just
 * `TabsState` + a title lookup.
 *
 * Unified process-identity model: every tab is a shell;
 * an engine is just a process running in it. A tab's turn detector target
 * is either the tab's OWN kobe-launched engine (by construction) or, for
 * any other tab, whatever its solo live PTY's OSC title says is running —
 * see `turn-polls.ts`'s header for the full rationale.
