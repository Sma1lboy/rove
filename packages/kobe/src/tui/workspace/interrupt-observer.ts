/**
 * ESC-interrupt observer — framework-free.
 *
 * An ESC interrupt ends a turn without ANY hook: claude-code's abort path
 * returns before its stop hooks run, so without this the daemon's
 * hook-driven `running` badge stays lit until the ~10min lapse watchdog
 * catches it. The one
 * event-grade signal an interrupt does produce is the engine's own OSC
 * title rewrite — the animated working frame (`⠂`/`⠐`, codex's braille)
 * flips back to the resting form the instant the turn stops
 * (`engineTitleTurnHint`).
 *
 * This observer watches exactly that: a tab whose HOOK state says
 * `running` while its live title says "rest" arms a confirm timer; if the
 * disagreement still holds when it fires, `report` tells the daemon the
 * turn was interrupted (`engine.reportEvent` kind `turn-interrupted`) and
 * every attached client's badge flips.
 *
 * The confirm delay is the Stop-race guard: on a NATURAL turn end the
 * title flips a beat before the Stop hook lands, so acting immediately
 * would race the real event and an interrupt report arriving after Stop
 * would eat the unseen-● lamp (reduce(turn_complete, turn-interrupted) →
 * idle). Any hook movement away from `running` during the window —
 * turn_complete, permission_needed, anything — disarms the pending
 * confirm; Stop always wins.

/**

 * outlive a natural turn end's title→Stop gap: the Stop hook is a spawned
 * `kobe hook` process plus one daemon RPC, well under a second on a sane
 * machine — 2.5s covers a loaded one with margin, while keeping the ESC
