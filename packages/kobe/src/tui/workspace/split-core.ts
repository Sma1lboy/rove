 * command, see `TerminalSplit.tsx`; later: any workspace surface);
 * groups lay their children out `row` (side-by-side, tmux's `%`) or
 * `column` (stacked, tmux's `"`). Splitting inside a group of the same
 * orientation inserts a sibling; splitting across orientations nests a
 * new group — arbitrary tmux-style layouts fall out of two chords.
 *
 * Framework-free on purpose, same architecture as `terminal-tabs-core.ts`:
 * the renderer owns signals/UI, this module owns the transitions
 * so vitest can pin them. Nothing in here may know about terminals,
 * PTYs, or engines — content-specific keying (e.g. `splitLeafPtyKey`)
