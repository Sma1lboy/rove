/**
 * Hook-wins merge of the two per-tab turn-state sources (framework-free).
 *
 * Two chains report "what is this tab's engine doing": the daemon's
 * hook-driven `engine-state` push (sub-second, carries `tabId` for every
 * kobe-spawned engine tab) and the local capture-pane quiescence poll
 * (3–6 s, works without hooks). This module owns the precedence rule:
 * per tabId, a live hook entry supersedes the poll's reading; the poll
 * keeps running untouched and re-owns the tab the moment the hook entry
 * clears (daemon publishes idle → client deletes the map entry) or never
 * appears (hooks not installed, daemon down when the hook fired). No
 * timers, no vendor knowledge — with no hook data the output is the poll
 * map byte-for-byte.
 *
 * Known ceiling: a dropped Stop pins the hook's `running` until the
 * daemon's per-tab lapse watchdog idles it (~10 min TTL) or the next
 * event; the poll's (correct) `done` is ignored for that window.
