/**
 * "Which engine is live in this tab right now" — the framework-free store

 *
 * NOT the OSC window title: that is free-form text an engine writes for
 * humans, so matching it by substring would relabel a claude session whose
 * activity summary happens to mention "codex" and attach a Codex turn
 * detector. Identity comes from the process tree instead — one `ps`
 * snapshot per tick serves every live PTY, and each tab's shell pid roots a
 * walk (`engine/foreground.ts`). A tab is "running claude" exactly while a
 * claude process is alive under its shell, and stops being so the moment
 * that process exits.
 *
 * Self-driving on purpose: it enumerates the PTY registry itself rather
 * than taking a caller-supplied key set, so the two consumers (turn-poll
 * attach, tab-strip titles) share ONE probe instead of racing each other's
 * reconcile.
