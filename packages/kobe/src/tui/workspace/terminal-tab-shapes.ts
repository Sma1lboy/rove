/**
 * The tab SHAPES — `TabBase` and the three `kind`-discriminated variants

 *
 * The seam is data vs. behavior: this file declares what a tab IS,
 * `terminal-tabs-core.ts` declares what happens TO the list of them. That
 * makes it the file everything else can depend on without depending on the
 * transitions — the split tree, argv composition and the component all need
 * the shapes, and none of them should be pulling in tab-list logic to get
 * them. Core re-exports these so importers still have one entry point.
 *
 * Types only — no runtime code, so the core↔shapes pair is erased at build
 * time and can never become an import cycle.
