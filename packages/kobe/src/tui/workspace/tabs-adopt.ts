/**
 * Adopt live-but-unregistered pty sessions into a task's tab state.
 *
 * The pty host holds the truth about what is running; the tab snapshot is a
 * record of intent, and the two diverge (a canonical-spawn
 * fallback, a tab closed while its task was unmounted so the kill never
 * reached the host, an older kobe). The sidebar already SHOWS such sessions
 * as `⚠` rows, but a row that isn't in the tab state can't be opened,
 * focused or closed: the owner sees a live engine he can neither read nor
 * end.
 *
 * So reconcile instead of only reporting: a live `<taskId>::<tabId>` session
 * the state doesn't list becomes a real engine tab under ITS OWN id, which
 * is what makes the ordinary open/close paths work on it (a mount attaches
 * to the existing host session under the same key — it does not respawn).
 * The adopted tab never steals `activeId`: adoption is bookkeeping, not a
 * navigation.
