/**
 * Line-anchored review comments on the read-only diff view — the
 * framework-free half (types, prompt format, unified-row mapping, the
 * kv-backed per-task store). The React UI lives in
 * `src/tui-react/ops/preview-review.tsx`; wiring into the engine PTY in
 * `src/tui-react/workspace/TerminalTabs.tsx`.
 *
 * The prompt format is ported from orca's `src/shared/diff-comments-format.ts`
 * (File / Line-or-range / quote-escaped User comment, blank-line separated)
 * — deliberately dead simple: it's the contract between review notes and
 * whichever engine consumes them.
 *
 * Anchoring ceiling (deliberate): a comment is file path + the display line
 * number of the diff it was written against. If the diff changes and lines
 * drift, the comment stays attached to file+stored line — no re-anchoring.
