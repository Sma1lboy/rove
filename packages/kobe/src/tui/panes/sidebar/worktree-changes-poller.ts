/**
 * Async, self-throttling poller behind the sidebar's per-row `+N −M`
 * worktree-changes chip.
 *
 * Why this exists: `git status` walks the working tree — O(repo size) —
 * so calling the synchronous `readWorktreeChanges` (`spawnSync git
 * status`) from a render path blocks the whole event loop for seconds
 * per tick on a huge repo. The sync helper survives ONLY for one-shot
 * CLI use (`kobe api`); render paths must go through this poller.
 *
 * The scheduling core (per-key Solid signal, in-flight dedupe, adaptive
 * cadence, timeout + hard backoff) is the generic
 * `src/tui/lib/background-poll.ts` — this module is the worktree-changes
 * binding: one async `git status --porcelain=v1` per worktree, parsed
 * into `+N −M` counts. Failure / timeout keeps the last value — the chip
 * goes stale or stays hidden rather than flashing a bogus zero, the same
 * "never error, just hide" contract as the sync helper.
 *
 * Deleted rows never call `poll()` at all (the Sidebar shows only live
 * tasks): a deleted task must not pay git-status for worktrees that no
 * longer matter — that's the exact original bug.
 *
 * Since issue #6 this poller is the NO-DAEMON FALLBACK only: when a
 * connected daemon advertises the `worktree.changes` channel (one
 * collector in the daemon, pushed counts), the Sidebar renders the pushes
 * and never calls `poll()` here — a pane spawns zero git processes while
 * daemon-connected. The daemon's collector
 * (`kobe-daemon/daemon/worktree-changes-collector.ts`) reuses the same
 * scheduling guards via `src/lib/poll-scheduling.ts`.
