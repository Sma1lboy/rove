/**
 * Tiny worktree-changes helper for the sidebar's per-row `+N −M` chip.
 *
 * Each task row renders a status badge + title; this helper feeds the
 * right-edge "uncommitted file counts" chip:
 *
 *   `+N` — files added, modified, renamed, copied, or untracked
 *   `−M` — files deleted (in index or worktree)
 *
 * Shows up next to the task title only when the worktree is dirty —
 * a clean tracked branch contributes nothing, so the row reads as it
 * always has.
 *
 * Implementation: a single synchronous `git status --porcelain=v1`
 * call, classified per row (any `D` in either column → `−`, anything
 * else → `+`). Falls back to all-zeros for any failure mode (missing
 * repo, EACCES, git not on PATH, worktree gone) so the chip is hidden
 * rather than showing a confusing error state. Never throws — the
 * sidebar must always render.
 *
 * ⚠️ SYNC — one-shot CLI use ONLY (`kobe api` task queries). `git
 * status` is O(repo size); calling this from a render path froze the
 * Tasks pane for the lifetime of a 30GB repo's status walk, every
 * tick. The sidebar reads through `worktree-changes-poller.ts` (async
 * spawn + in-flight dedupe + timeout/backoff) instead — new render-
 * path consumers must too. Only `parsePorcelain` is shared.
 *
 * Why a separate file rather than reaching into
 * `src/orchestrator/worktree/manager.ts#isDirty`: that one is `async`,
 * boolean-only, and throws. The sidebar is sync, needs counts, and
 * tolerates every failure mode. Same trade-off `git-head.ts` and
 * `src/tui/panes/filetree/git.ts` made — pane-side git wrappers are
 * intentionally separate from the orchestrator's stricter ones.
