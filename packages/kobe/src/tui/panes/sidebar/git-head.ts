/**
 * Tiny git-HEAD poller for the sidebar's pinned "main" task rows.
 *
 * Each main task is bound to a saved repo and shows the repo's
 * live current branch as a right-aligned hint — the row reads e.g.
 * `○ kobe   main`. The branch isn't stored on the task; it's computed
 * at display time so checking out a different branch in another shell
 * is reflected the next time the sidebar re-renders.
 *
 * Implementation: an ASYNC `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` through the
 * generic `src/tui/lib/background-poll.ts` poller. The commands are O(1)
 * — they read a ref, not the working tree — but even an O(1) spawnSync
 * per project row per ~2s tick is a render-thread block (slow disk, NFS,
 * cold cache), so the render path never spawns synchronously; the memo
 * fires `pollCurrentBranch` and reads the signal. Falls back to
 * `(detached)` if the HEAD is detached (symbolic-ref exits non-zero but
 * rev-parse verifies a HEAD) or `""` for any other failure mode (missing
 * repo, EACCES, git not on PATH) so the renderer skips the hint entirely
 * rather than showing a confusing error string. Never throws — the
 * sidebar must always render.
 *
 * Why a separate file rather than reaching into
 * `src/orchestrator/worktree/manager.ts#currentBranch`: that method
 * throws on detached-HEAD. The sidebar must tolerate every failure mode.
 * Same trade-off `src/tui/panes/filetree/git.ts` made — pane-side git
 * wrappers are intentionally separate from the orchestrator's stricter
 * ones.
