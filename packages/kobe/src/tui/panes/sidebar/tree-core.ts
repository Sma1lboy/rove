/**
 * Sidebar tree shaping — project → Task → Terminal Tab, as ONE flat row list.
 *
 * The owner's call (2026-08-01) retires the horizontal chattab strip: a
 * a Task's tabs become child rows under it in the sidebar, and the right
 * side is nothing but the active terminal. This module owns the shape; the
 * renderer owns the glyphs.
 *
 * Why flat rows with a `depth` instead of a nested structure: the entire
 * sidebar navigation model is a cursor over `flatTaskIds` (see
 * `controller.ts`) — j/k/gg/search/ctrl+digit all index into that one array.
 * Emitting tab rows into the SAME array means every one of those behaviours
 * extends to tabs for free, and a tab row is selectable by exactly the
 * mechanism that already selects tasks. A tree of nested arrays would have
 * required a parallel traversal for each.
 *
 * The row id is the navigation key, so it must be unique across both kinds:
 * a task row keys on the task id, a tab row on `${taskId}::${tabId}` — the
 * same composite the PTY registry already uses for tab keys, so the two
 * never disagree about what identifies a tab.
