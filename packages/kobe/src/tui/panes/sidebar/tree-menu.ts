/**
 * What the tree sidebar's right-click menu offers on a given row.
 *
 * The rule that decides the list: **a row's menu is what that row's KEYBOARD
 * already does.** Nothing here is a new capability — every entry routes to a
 * callback the tree was already wired to, so the menu is a second route for
 * mouse users rather than a second set of rules to keep in sync. That is also
 * why a tab row lists the per-task verbs: the chords behave that way already
 * (`withCursorTask` walks up from a tab to its worktree, because rename /
 * delete have no tab-level meaning).
 *
 * The new-conversation pair reads the same rule one pane over (owner ask
 * 2026-08-18): ctrl+e already opens the engine/shell picker for the task the
 * row points at, so the menu routes to THAT — the entry activates the row and
 * hands the request to its workspace, exactly like pressing the chord there.
 *
 * No Expand/Collapse entries anywhere: the tree has no fold (owner call
 * 2026-08-01) — every level always shows everything.
 *
 * Pure: labels are i18n KEYS, not text. The renderer runs them through `t()`
 * so the menu follows a language switch like everything else.
