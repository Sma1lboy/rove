/**
 * Pure row model for the file tree pane — extracted from `FileTree.tsx`
 * so it stays unit-testable (the component file drags in `@opentui`,
 * which vitest/node cannot load; see `index.ts`).
 *
 * The load-bearing export is {@link reconcileRows}: the Ops pane's
 * fs-watch refresh re-fetches `git ls-files` / `git status` and rebuilds
 * the row list from scratch, so every refresh used to produce ALL-NEW row
 * objects. Solid's `<For>` keys by object identity, which meant each
 * refresh destroyed and recreated every row's opentui renderables —
 * and @opentui/core 0.2.4 retains a small amount of native memory per
 * renderable create/destroy cycle (~300B; JS heap stays flat while RSS
 * climbs). A busy engine worktree refreshes thousands of times a day,
 * which is exactly the multi-GB Ops-pane growth observed in production.
 * Reconciling by row key keeps the previous object whenever its fields
 * are unchanged, so `<For>` reuses the existing renderables and the
 * native churn drops to "rows that actually changed".
