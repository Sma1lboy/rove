/**
 * LOCAL PATCH for an opentui attribute leak (kept in kobe rather than
 * upstreamed — see the `sealRowEndAttributes` call in the React pane).
 *
 * opentui's zig diff renderer declares `runLength` INSIDE its per-row loop
 * (`renderer.zig`, `prepareRenderFrameWithWriter`) while its SGR writer only
 * ever ADDS attribute bits (`ansi.zig` emits `\e[4m`, never `\e[24m`). So the
 * first cell of a new row takes the `runStart == -1` branch with
 * `runLength == 0` and SKIPS the `\e[0m` reset — any attribute still open at
 * the end of the previous row bleeds into every following row until some
 * other run happens to reset. A styled run that reaches the LAST column is
 * exactly what triggers it, i.e. a wrapped URL: the terminal draws the rest
 * of the frame underlined ("link underline runs off into the text below").
 *
 * The fix has to live where the row still exists as data: clear the
 * attributes on the final cell of a row that fills the full width, and
 * preserve what those attributes were DRAWING by resolving them to explicit
 * colors — INVERSE becomes a literal fg/bg swap, so a cursor or selection
 * cell parked in the last column keeps its highlight instead of vanishing.
 * Underline/bold/italic lose one cell of decoration at the wrap point; that
 * is the whole cost, and it is invisible next to a frame-wide bleed.
 *
 * Rows shorter than `cols` need no sealing: their run is followed by another
 * chunk on the same row, which resets normally.
