 * on every PTY frame, so flow anchors were invalidated mid-drag:
 * glitchy highlight, empty extraction).
 *
 * Everything here is pure and cell-addressed: a selection is an anchor
 * and a head in ABSOLUTE snapshot coordinates (row = index into the
 * full snapshot row array, col = terminal column), normalized into
 * per-row spans with linear reading-order semantics (first row from
 * the start column, middle rows whole, last row to the end column) —
 * exactly xterm/tmux selection shape. The component owns the mouse
 * wiring and the copy; `overlaySelection` reuses the cursor overlay's
 * chunk-splitting to paint the highlight, so it survives every frame
 * refresh untouched.

 * element the press started on, so a drag that leaves the pane keeps
 * reporting real coordinates.
 *
 * `edgePull` counts from the EDGE ROW, not from outside the pane — the first
 * visible row already pulls by 1, one row above it by 2, and so on (mirrored
 * at the bottom). A terminal pane sits flush under a one-row tab strip, so
 * "drag beyond the pane" is a one-row target the pointer rarely hits;
 * emulators scroll at the pane boundary itself, and so do we. The cell stays
 * a valid snapshot address either way (column clamped to the grid, row to the
 * snapshot). Selection coordinates are absolute, so the row under a
 * stationary pointer changes as the viewport scrolls — that is what lets a
 * held drag keep extending into scrollback.
