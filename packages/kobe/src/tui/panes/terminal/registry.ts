/**
 * `PtyRegistry` — one PTY per task, kept alive while the task is in
 * progress, released when the task is deleted.
 *
 * The Stream J brief locks in the "one pty per task" rule (see
 * `docs/PLAN.md` §J Resolved Decision). The pane mounts and unmounts
 * per render (every time the user switches the active task or remounts
 * the layout), but the underlying shell shouldn't restart on every
 * mount — that would lose scrollback and any in-flight commands. The
 * registry decouples pane lifecycle (per-render) from shell lifecycle
 * (per-task).
 *
 * Contract (mirrored in `Terminal.tsx`):
 *
 *   - `acquire(taskId, cwd)` returns the existing `TaskPty` for the
 *     task, or creates a new one. Subsequent `acquire`s with the same
 *     id return the same instance.
 *   - `release(taskId)` kills the PTY and forgets it. Called when the
 *     task is deleted.
 *   - `releaseAll()` kills every registered PTY. Called on app
 *     teardown to avoid leaking shell processes.
 *
 * What the registry deliberately does NOT do:
 *   - It does not subscribe to task status changes. The orchestrator
 *     (Stream E) is responsible for calling `release()` when a task
 *     transitions to `done` / etc. The registry is a dumb container.
 *   - It does not cap concurrency. PLAN.md §4 caps simultaneous
 *     *running* tasks at 4, but a paused-but-in-progress task may
 *     still hold a live PTY.
 *
 * PTY parking (issues #28/#29) — AUTOMATIC again since 2026-07-12: the
 * idle sweep detaches hidden tabs' xterm instances, but each handle now
 * serializes its full screen first (`capturePark` → SerializeAddon VT
 * stream, ~100-200KB in `this.parked`) and the wake feeds that stream
 * plus the host's EXACT byte delta since park (`pty.open sinceOffset`)
 * into the fresh emulator — bit-identical to never detaching, which
 * removes the 2026-07-10 objection (the 512KB ring replay couldn't
 * rebuild a long session's screen). When the delta was trimmed away or
 * the child was respawned, the wake degrades to the old full-replay +
 * repaint-wiggle path.
 *
 * Concurrency: every method is synchronous and JS is single-threaded,
 * so there's no race within a single registry. Two registries pointing
 * at the same task id return the same in-process shell handle. The
 * Solid component creates exactly one registry per app instance; tests
 * stand up disposable registries inside a single `describe` block.
