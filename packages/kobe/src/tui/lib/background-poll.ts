/**
 * Generic background poller for render paths that need subprocess-derived
 * data (git status, git HEAD, …) without ever blocking the event loop.
 *
 * Extracted from the sidebar's worktree-changes poller — the fix for the
 * 30GB-repo freeze, where a synchronous per-row `git status` on the ~2s
 * tick blocked the render thread for the whole O(repo size) status walk.
 * The rule (see docs/DESIGN.md §5.4 and the guard test
 * `test/tui/render-path-sync-guard.test.ts`): render processes must not
 * run synchronous subprocesses. A pane that wants live subprocess data
 * creates one of these pollers and calls `poll(key)` from its memo —
 * fire-and-forget — while `read(key)` stays a cheap reactive signal read.
 *
 * One poller instance owns a module-level entry map: per key (a repo /
 * worktree path), a value cell holding the last good value plus
 * scheduling state. Three guards keep the child-process budget sane:
 *
 *   - **in-flight dedupe** — one run per key at a time; ticks that land
 *     while a run is still going are dropped.
 *   - **adaptive cadence** — the next run is allowed only after
 *     `max(minIntervalMs, 5 × last duration)`: fast repos keep the tick
 *     cadence, slow-but-finishing repos thin out on their own.
 *   - **timeout + backoff** — a run exceeding `timeoutMs` is aborted
 *     (children spawned via `spawnCapture` get SIGKILLed) and the key
 *     backs off for `slowRetryMs`.
 *
 * The guards themselves (the pure scheduling math + the abort/timeout run
 * wrapper + `spawnCapture`) live in the dependency-free
 * `src/lib/poll-scheduling.ts`, shared with the DAEMON's worktree-changes
 * collector — this module holds a per-key value cell that `poll`
 * writes and `read` returns. Callers (the React panes) read imperatively on
 * their own render cadence; the re-exports below keep this module's public
 * API stable for them.
 *
 * Failure contract: a run that throws, is aborted, or resolves after the
 * timeout never writes — `read` keeps returning the last good value (or
 * `initial`), so the UI goes stale or stays hidden rather than erroring.
