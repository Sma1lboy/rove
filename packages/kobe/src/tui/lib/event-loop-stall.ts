/**
 * Event-loop stall telemetry: when the TUI "freezes", nothing after the
 * fact distinguishes an event loop blocked by JS (a kobe bug — `sample`
 * would show the stack) from the whole
 * process being paged out under memory pressure (an OS-level stall — nothing
 * in-process is at fault). A 1s heartbeat measures wall-clock drift; when a
 * beat arrives far later than scheduled, the gap IS the stall, and the log
 * line carries heap numbers so the next freeze report starts with ground
 * truth instead of inference.
 *
 * Interpretation guide for the log line:
 *   - big gap + rss far above heapUsed → process was swapped/paged (OS)
 *   - big gap + heapUsed near rss      → suspect in-process work; `sample`
 *     the pid during the next stall to get the stack
