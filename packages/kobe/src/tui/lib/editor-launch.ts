/**
 * External-editor launch for the Ops pane's file tree (`enter` — `files.open`
 * in `tui/context/keybindings-files.ts`).
 *
 * `enter` opens the file in the user's real editor (nvim / vim / nano / a
 * custom command) in an embedded command tab. The in-TUI read-only
 * preview/diff window (`openPreview`) is the FALLBACK below, not a separate
 * key: it is where `enter` lands when no editor binary can be resolved.
 *
 * Why shell out instead of editing in-pane: the preview is an opentui
 * `<code>`/`<diff>` renderer with no cursor/insert/save. A real editable
 * buffer would mean reimplementing a text editor in the TUI; launching
 * vim/nano/$EDITOR is what lazygit/gitui do and it's strictly better.
 *
 * Fallback chain (KOB — file-editor-launch): if the configured editor's
 * binary isn't on PATH (or `custom` is empty with no `$EDITOR`), this
 * returns `false` and the caller falls back to the read-only preview, so
 * `enter` is never a dead key. We gate on "binary missing", NOT on the
 * editor's exit code — a `:cq` / non-zero quit is a real edit session,
 * not a launch failure, and must not bounce to preview.
 *
 * nvim/vim diff mode: when the resolved editor is a PLAIN nvim/vim open
 * (`<bin> <file>`, no custom flags) AND the file differs from HEAD, `enter`
 * upgrades to side-by-side diff mode — the committed HEAD blob read-only
 * on the left, the live editable file on the right. This is the sh-`-c`
 * safe form of `nvim -d <file> <(git show HEAD:<file>)`: tmux runs the
 * window via `sh -c`, which has no `<(…)` process substitution, so the
 * HEAD blob is dumped to a tmp file (the explicit stand-in for the
 * process-substitution fd) and `rm`-ed when the editor exits. Nothing
 * touches the user's nvim config or the repo — zero-install, zero-config.
 * A custom command with its own flags is never rewritten.
 *
 * Settings (shared `state.json`, read cross-process via getPersistedString
 * since the Ops host is its own process):
 *   - `editor.kind`          "auto" | "vim" | "nvim" | "nano" | "emacs" |
 *                            "custom"   (default "auto" — see `editor-prefs.ts`)
 *   - `editor.customCommand` e.g. `code -w` / `emacsclient` / `subl -w {file}`
