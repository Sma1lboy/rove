/**
 * Central keybinding registry for kobe.
 *
 * Single source of truth for: which chords trigger which action and what
 * the help dialog (F1) + Tasks-pane footer legend display. Panes register
 * handlers by binding **id** (`bindByIds`) — they don't hardcode chord
 * strings. A future settings UI can edit `KobeKeymap` (in-memory or
 * persisted via KV) without any pane having to know.
 *
 * Hand-off contract:
 *   - `id` is stable. Tests + settings persistence key off it.
 *   - `keys` is the list of chords that register the action. The first
 *     entry is the canonical chord (the displayed cap when there is no
 *     `hint.keys` override). Multiple chords are common when a
 *     terminal delivers the same logical key as different byte sequences
 *     (`ctrl+k`/`alt+k`) or when several keys do the same thing
 *     (`j`/`down`).
 *   - `scope` says whether the binding is registered globally or only
 *     when a specific pane is focused. The pane that owns the scope
 *     calls `bindByIds(...)` with the same id → the chord(s) come from
 *     this table.
 *   - `hint` is cosmetic display metadata: a friendly pseudo-chord
 *     (`j/k`, `prefix+j`, etc.) read by the two hint consumers — the
 *     help dialog's (F1) primary cap and the Tasks-pane footer legend
 *     (`capOf`/`legendCap` in `lib/help-groups.ts`). `hint == null` means
 *     no friendly display override — the canonical chord shows instead.
 *   - `description` + `category` feed the help dialog (F1).
 *
 * Hint vs. chord:
 *   - Legends may show a collapsed pseudo-chord (e.g. "j/k" for four
 *     real chords or "1/2/3") — that's `hint.keys`. The actually
 *     registered chords stay in `keys` and remain individually testable.
 *
 * Re-binding a chord = mutate `keys` for the relevant id. Users do this
 * via `~/.rove/settings/keybindings.yaml`, applied once at TUI boot by
 * `applyUserKeybindings()` (context/keybindings-user.ts), which mutates
 * this table in place. No pane code has to change because pane
 * registration goes through `bindByIds` and the help dialog / footer
 * legend render from the (already-overridden) rows.
 *
 * Cmd / Option / Ctrl on macOS — three different modifiers, three different
 * chord prefixes:
 *
 *   - `ctrl+X`  always works; ctrl+letter has stable C0 byte mappings that
 *     every terminal forwards to the TTY. Use this as the primary chord.
 *   - `alt+X`   is the Option key on macOS. Sends `ESC X` in legacy mode and
 *     opentui surfaces it as `evt.option = true`. Note: macOS launchers
 *     (Raycast, Karabiner, Alfred) often grab Option+digit globally before it
 *     reaches the terminal. Don't rely on alt-chords as the only path.
 *   - `cmd+X`   is the Command key on macOS. Default-config terminals
 *     (Terminal.app, iTerm2, Ghostty) handle Cmd+letter as an *application*
 *     shortcut and never forward it to the TTY — so a `cmd+X` binding is a
 *     no-op there. Terminals that *can* forward modifier keys (Kitty,
 *     iTerm2 with "Send Modifier Keys" enabled, Ghostty with `keybind`) do
 *     deliver Cmd+X as `evt.meta = true`, which our keymap layer surfaces
 *     as `cmd+X`. Register `cmd+X` alongside the primary `ctrl+X` so users
 *     on forwarding terminals get the chord they expect (and `cmd+X`
 *     doesn't get silently swallowed by the stdin reader for lack of a
 *     binding).
 *
 * The native workspace also registers `ctrl+q` while the sidebar is focused,
 * matching the tmux handover's two-stage detach shape: first ctrl+q returns to
 * Tasks, second ctrl+q exits the attached UI. Plain `q` remains the sidebar
 * quit-confirm shortcut.
