/**
 * i18n message catalog — the per-namespace message files composed into one
 * `en` / `zh` tree.
 *
 * English (`en`) is the SOURCE OF TRUTH: it defines the `Messages` shape every
 * other locale must satisfy. `zh` (简体中文) must carry the exact same key set —
 * `bun run check-i18n` and `test/tui/i18n-catalog.test.ts` (CI) fail on any
 * missing/extra key or dropped `{placeholder}` so the two never drift.
 *
 * Each surface owns its own file under `./messages/` (settings, tasks, files,
 * …) so translation work parallelizes without colliding. Pure data, zero
 * runtime deps — safe under node / vitest (the observable `t()` runtime lives
 * in `./index.ts`). Values may contain `{name}`
 * placeholders; `t(key, params)` substitutes them.
 *
 * We translate prose; literal config syntax (YAML keys, shell command
 * examples) is left in the calling code as-is — it isn't language.
