/**
 * Repo-convention branch naming.
 *
 * A managed task's auto branch must not bake the tool's brand into the user's
 * git history (`rove/<slug>-<id6>` and the like). Instead we scan the target
 * repo's existing branch names (local + origin) and infer its dominant
 * naming style — conventional type prefixes (`feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, …)
 * or bare kebab slugs — then apply that style to a slug derived from the
 * task title. Guarantees:
 *
 *   - The generated name NEVER contains "rove" or "kobe" (brand tokens are
 *     stripped from the slug; prefixes only come from the conventional set).
 *   - Collisions get a short `-2` / `-3` suffix, not a machine ulid tail.
 *   - No inferable convention (empty repo, no branches) → bare kebab slug.
 *
 * Everything here is pure; the coordinator supplies the branch-name list
 * and the taken-set.
