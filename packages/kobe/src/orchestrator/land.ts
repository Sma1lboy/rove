/**
 * `landTask` executor — collect a task's branch back into its base repo.
 *
 * The product unit is `Task = worktree + engine session + branch`, and every
 * step of that had a product path EXCEPT the last one: collecting the branch.
 * Every fan-out round ("pick the winner") and every task wrap-up meant leaving
 * kobe to hand-run `git merge` in the main checkout, self-check it was clean,
 * and copy the conflict list by hand. This does that one step.
 *
 * v1 scope (deliberately small — see the orch brief): merge OR squash-merge the
 * task's branch into the base repo's CURRENT branch, in the main checkout.
 * Refuse up front if the main checkout is dirty (same guard shape as
 * `deleteTask`'s {@link DirtyWorktreeError}). On a merge conflict, `git merge
 * --abort` immediately and throw the conflicted-file list — the human resolves
 * it by hand for now (auto-repair-via-engine is v2). Zero new deps: git CLI
 * subprocesses through the same {@link ExecHost} the worktree manager uses.
