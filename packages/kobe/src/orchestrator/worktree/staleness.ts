/**
 * Ranks the signals `worktree.list` collects into verdict badges. Strongest
 * first; weaker ones are FALLBACKS when stronger are unavailable (no GitHub
 * remote, no/unauthenticated `gh`, offline):
 *
 *   1. dirty working tree        → active  (uncommitted work, never stale)
 *   2. open PR on the branch     → active  (in review)
 *   3. PR merged                 → merged  (safe to clean — the ONLY
 *                                  signal that survives kobe's default
 *                                  squash-merge, which never makes branch
 *                                  commits ancestors of main)
 *   4. 0 commits ahead of the    → merged  (history-level: everything the
 *      default branch                        branch has is already in main;
 *                                            also covers a never-committed
 *                                            worktree — equally cleanable)
 *   5. PR closed without merging → stale   (abandoned)
 *   6. no activity for 14 days   → stale   (age fallback)
 *   7. otherwise                 → fresh
