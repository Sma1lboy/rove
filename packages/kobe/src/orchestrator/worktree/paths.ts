/**
 * Canonical filesystem layout for Rove-managed worktrees.
 *
 * The worktree root is per-repo and lives in Rove's state dir at
 * `~/.rove/worktrees/<repo-key>/<slug>/` (or under `$ROVE_HOME_DIR`
 * when overridden). `<slug>` is an animal-name slug for tasks
 * created after the switch, or the task's ULID for older records whose
 * path is already persisted.
 *
 * Backwards compatibility: older checkouts hold worktrees under
 * repo-local `<repo>/.kobe/worktrees/<slug>/` or
 * `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<slug>/`. Existing tasks in both roots
 * remain managed and discoverable, but new Rove-created tasks use the
 * global Rove state dir so no repo-level `.gitignore` entry is needed.
 *
 * Keeping this in one place means the orchestrator, the worktree
 * manager, the task index, and any future "list all kobe worktrees"
 * tool agree on where to look — no string concatenation scattered
 * across modules.
 *
 * `<repo>` is always absolute. Callers must normalize before invoking.
