/**
 * `GitWorktreeManager` — Stream B's deliverable.
 *
 * Implements `WorktreeManager` from `src/types/worktree.ts`. Wraps
 * `git worktree add/remove/list` plus the few status probes (dirty,
 * current branch) that the orchestrator and the sidebar need.
 *
 * Invariants preserved here (matching the interface contract):
 *   - `create()` is idempotent. If a worktree already lives at `path`
 *     and is checked out on `branch`, we return its info. If the path
 *     exists with a *different* branch, we throw — never hijack.
 *   - `create()` makes the branch when it doesn't yet exist (rooted at
 *     the repo's current HEAD), and reuses the existing branch when it
 *     does. We never silently fast-forward a branch that already has
 *     work on it.
 *   - `remove()` refuses to delete a dirty worktree unless `force` is
 *     true. The single most important safety property of this module:
 *     "I lost my changes because Rove deleted the worktree" must be
 *     impossible without explicit consent.
 *   - `list()` only returns worktrees inside Rove-managed roots
 *     (`~/.rove/worktrees/<repo-key>/` plus legacy global/repo-local roots).
 *     Worktrees the user created outside these roots are invisible to Rove.
 *
 * Reference (read, not ported): `refs/vibe-kanban/crates/worktree-manager/`
 * for cleanup invariants and dirty-state semantics.
