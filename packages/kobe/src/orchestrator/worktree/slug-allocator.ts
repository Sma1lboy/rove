/**
 * Allocate animal-name slugs for worktree directories.
 *
 * Replaces the old "directory = task ULID" scheme (which produced 26-
 * char dir names that overflowed the terminal pane). The new shape is:
 *
 *   ~/.rove/worktrees/<repo-key>/panda/
 *   ~/.rove/worktrees/<repo-key>/panda-v2/   # if `panda` was recycled
 *
 * Mechanism (mirrors Conductor's city-name scheme):
 *   1. Build the "occupied" set: every slug currently held by an
 *      active task in the store, PLUS every directory name already
 *      present on disk under kobe-managed worktree roots, PLUS any
 *      slugs picked for the same repo by an earlier `allocate()` call
 *      that haven't yet been committed (race window between picking
 *      and persisting to the store).
 *   2. Filter {@link ANIMAL_NAMES} to candidates not in `occupied`.
 *   3. Pick one randomly. If the candidate set is empty (pool
 *      exhausted by ~410 simultaneous active worktrees in one repo —
 *      not realistic for kobe's use case), pick any base name and
 *      append `-v2`/`-v3`/... until one is free.
 *
 * Concurrency:
 *   - `allocate()` is async-serialized via a chain promise so two
 *     concurrent calls cannot pick the same slug. Inside the chain we
 *     refresh the occupied set on every iteration so the second caller
 *     sees the first caller's pick (via the per-repo pending set).
 *   - Callers commit / cancel the pick via {@link commit} /
 *     {@link cancel}. Commit clears the pending entry; cancel does
 *     the same (the difference is purely intent — both free the slot).
 *
 * Daemon mode: in-process serialization is enough because a single
 * daemon owns the task store. Two daemons against the same repo would
 * race, but that's already broken on the store's tasks.json writes.
