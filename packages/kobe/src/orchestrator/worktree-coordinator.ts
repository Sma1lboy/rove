/**
 * Worktree lifecycle side-effects for the {@link Orchestrator}.
 *
 * The Orchestrator owns the task index + reactive snapshot; this collaborator
 * owns everything that actually touches git worktrees on disk — slug
 * allocation, the lazy materialise-on-first-enter dance, adoption of
 * pre-existing worktrees, and the per-task / per-path locks that keep those
 * operations race- and delete-safe. The Orchestrator holds one of these and
 * delegates; its public methods stay thin so the class interface is unchanged.
 *
 * All the load-bearing invariants live here verbatim (moved out of
 * `core.ts`, no behaviour change):
 *
 *   - **Lazy allocation.** `createTask` records intent (empty `worktreePath`);
 *     the directory only materialises when {@link ensure} runs on first enter.
 *   - **Dedupe + delete-safety.** {@link ensure} / {@link adopt} return the
 *     shared in-flight promise so a concurrent caller reads the created path
 *     rather than re-reading the store (which would throw if a delete landed
 *     in that window).
 *   - **Self-cleaning rollback.** {@link createWorktree} commits the slug ONLY
 *     after the store write succeeds; any partial failure removes the
 *     just-created worktree and frees the slug so nothing is orphaned.
