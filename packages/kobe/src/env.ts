/**
 * Centralised environment / runtime flag access.
 *
 * Convention: renamed controls accept `ROVE_*` first and fall back to their
 * `KOBE_*` aliases. Any new production read goes through here. Test-only env vars (`KOBE_TEST_ENGINE`,
 * `KOBE_TEST_FAKE_PORT`, the per-pane `KOBE_*_HOST` fixtures, etc.)
 * stay where they are — they're internal plumbing for the harness,
 * not part of kobe's user-facing surface.
 *
 * The win of routing reads through here:
 *
 *   1. One place to learn which knobs the binary respects.
 *   2. Typed, validated accessors (no `process.env.KOBE_X === "1"`
 *      stringly-typed checks scattered through the codebase).
 *   3. Easy to mock in unit tests — just stub the function.
 *   4. Documents the *intent* of each variable in the comment, not
 *      buried at its first use site.
 *
 * This is *not* a generic config layer. We don't load `.env` files,
 * don't cascade through `~/.rove/config.json`, don't do any of that.
 * If we ever need that, build a `loadConfig()` that returns a frozen
 * record once at startup and have these accessors read from it.
