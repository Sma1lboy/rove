/**
 * Shared row-selection semantics for navigation panes.
 *
 * Pane focus belongs to the pane frame (`focusAccent`). Rows deliberately
 * stay neutral: the movable keyboard cursor gets the strongest local marker
 * and tint, while a persistent selection remains visible after the cursor
 * moves without pretending the pane owns global focus.
 *
 * Transparent mode: NO background fill at all — an
 * opaque tint block on top of the host wallpaper reads as a mismatched
 * patch, so the cursor signal moves entirely into the ▌ marker, which takes
 * the focus accent to stay visible against any wallpaper. Detected off the
 * resolved theme itself (`applyDisplayOverlay` zeroes `background`'s alpha),
 * so no caller has to thread the toggle through.
