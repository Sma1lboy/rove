/**
 * React key-bindings layer (issue #15, G2) — the `src/tui/lib/keymap.tsx`
 * counterpart for React panes. The dispatcher core (LIFO stack walk, chord
 * matching, preventDefault-on-first-hit) is the shared framework-free
 * `src/tui/lib/keymap-dispatch.ts`; this file owns only registration.
 *
 * Contract parity with the Solid hook:
 *   - `config` is re-evaluated on EVERY keypress. The Solid version relies
 *     on closures over signals staying live; React closures go stale across
 *     renders, so the registered entry reads the LATEST config through a
 *     ref that every render refreshes.
 *   - Bindings stack LIFO; only the topmost enabled match fires.
 *
 * Known ordering difference (documented, accepted for the migration): Solid
 * registers during component SETUP (parents before children → children end
 * up on top); React registers in mount EFFECTS (children before parents →
 * ancestors end up on top). Consequence: a parent and child sharing a chord
 * must resolve by GATING, not stack order — the parent's entry disables
 * itself when the child should win. Case today: TerminalTabs' ctrl+w/F2
 * (gate off while the active tab is split so TerminalSplit's leaf-level
 * close/rename fire). Modal barrier vs dialog body is NOT resolved by
 * order anymore — it's declared via `ModalScopeContext` + `modalOwner`
 * below and settled by `insertRegistration`.
