/**
 * "Was there a click ANYWHERE?" — one renderer-root mouse-down listener,
 * shared by every surface that dismisses itself on an outside click.
 *
 * opentui bubbles a mouse event up the renderable chain until someone calls
 * `stopPropagation`, so the root sees every press the app didn't swallow.
 * Nothing in the TUI stops the DOWN phase (the panes' guards all sit on
 * `onMouseUp`), which makes root-level down the one signal that means "the
 * user just pressed somewhere else" without every pane having to report it.
 *
 * A surface that must NOT self-dismiss on its own press stops the down event
 * itself (see `ui/context-menu.tsx`) — that keeps "is this press mine?" a
 * hit-test opentui already answers, instead of geometry every subscriber
 * would have to recompute.
 *
 * Framework-free on purpose: the React face is `use-global-mouse-down.ts`.
