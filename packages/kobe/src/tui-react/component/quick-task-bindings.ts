/**
 * Pure binding builder for the quick-task composer — extracted from
 * `quick-task-composer.tsx` so the field-gating contract is
 * vitest-testable (the component file drags in `@opentui`).
 *
 * THE contract, and what "type a prompt, hit enter" depends on: a
 * matched binding consumes its keypress — `dispatchKeyEvent` calls
 * `preventDefault()` on every hit, so the focused input never sees the
 * key. Field-dependent chords therefore must be gated at REGISTRATION:
 * `return` / `left` / `right` exist in the returned list ONLY while the
 * engine chip row is focused. On the prompt/branch fields they're
 * absent, so Enter falls through to the input's own `onSubmit` (commit)
 * and ←/→ move the input cursor.
