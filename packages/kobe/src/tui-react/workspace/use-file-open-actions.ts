/**
 * The two FileTree "open this file" actions the workspace host hands down:
 * Enter (editor / plugin / OS opener) and `d` (read-only diff tab).
 *
 * Both reach the live TerminalTabs mount through imperative refs the host
 * owns, so they take those refs rather than closing over host state — the
 * mount is re-handed on every task/worktree switch.
