/**
 * Zen mode state for the PureTUI workspace: the layout collapses
 * to the engine pane, hiding files and terminal (and the Tasks rail too, when
 * `zen.keepTasks` is off).
 *
 * The on/off intent is persisted under `zen.active`, so the workspace comes
 * back in the layout it left in — Settings → General → "Start in zen mode"
 * edits the same key, which makes that row both the startup default and a
 * mirror of the live state.
 *
 * Read/written through the KV context rather than `state/zen.ts`'s helpers so
 * this shares the Settings dialog's cache; the two layers write the same
 * state.json but would disagree until a reload if they cached separately.
