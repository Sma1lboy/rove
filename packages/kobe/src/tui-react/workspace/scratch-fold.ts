/**
 * Fold a scratch shell into the task that already owns its cwd — the
 * execution half of `decideScratchAdopt`'s `fold` verdict. Repointing the
 * scratch row at the repo instead would mint a duplicate sidebar row for a
 * directory some task already names, so the shell's HOSTED sessions
 * are re-keyed under the owning task's next free tab ids (`pty.rename` — the
 * child keeps running, engine and all) and the tab records are adopted
 * through the ordinary orphan-adoption write (`adoptTaskTabs`), which never
 * steals the target's active tab. The caller then deletes the emptied
 * scratch row.
 *
 * Hosted backend only: a local (`Bun.spawn`) shell lives inside this
 * process keyed to the scratch task and cannot change owners host-side —
 * `rename` answers false and the shell simply STAYS in Scratch (quiet,
 * retried each tick), which beats minting the duplicate row this fixes.
