/**
 * Framework-free live-title subscription store — the ONE "ptyKey → live
 * foreground-process display title" reconciler shared by the workspace
 * terminal surfaces. Two properties are load-bearing, and a hand-written
 * subscription pass tends to miss both:
 *
 *   - INSTANCE-compared, not `has(key)`: release + respawn at the same key
 *     must re-subscribe, or the leaf keeps a subscription pinned to the dead
 *     PTY and freezes on its last title.
 *   - keyed on the GLOBALLY-UNIQUE registry ptyKey
 *     (`splitLeafPtyKey(tabKey, id)` / `soloKey(...)`), not on the bare leaf
 *     id: TerminalSplit mounts without a React key, so its instance survives
 *     tab switches while every tab's leaves start at `leaf-1` — a bare-id
 *     subscription bleeds one tab's title onto the next tab's `leaf-1`.
 *
 * Reconcile is therefore: for each requested ptyKey, resolve the registry
 * PTY, (re)subscribe when the instance at that key changed, and drop
 * subscriptions whose key is unrequested or whose PTY died.
 *
 * The STORE keeps titles raw — the OSC stream IS the label. Collapsing an
 * engine's title to its binary ("✳ Claude Code" → "claude") via the
 * live-engine vendor would (a) throw away the one line of live status the
 * engine writes and (b) FLICKER: the ps-walk probe transiently loses a vendor
 * mid-turn, so labels would flap raw ↔ collapsed every probe tick. Identity
 * (which detector to attach) comes from the process tree; display does not.
 *
 * What the RENDER projections below (and use-turn-polls' twin) do strip is
 * the engine's leading STATUS decoration — claude's `✳`/`⠂`/`⠐`, codex's
 * spinner frame — because kobe draws that state in its own glyph column and
 * showing both says it twice. That is a display concern,
 * so it lives in the projection, not in the store, and the vocabulary is
 * declared per engine (`terminalTitle.statusPrefixes`). The name itself is
 * still never rewritten.
 *
 * No React, no @opentui — plain closures over Maps, unit-testable
 * under vitest. Callers own the tick that drives `reconcile()` (a PTY spawns
 * asynchronously after its Terminal mounts, so the attach must retry).
