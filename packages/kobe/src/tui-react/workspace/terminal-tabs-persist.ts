/**
 * Persisted terminal-tab snapshot reclamation (O19) — the `terminalTabs.*` kv
 * keys `TerminalTabs.tsx` writes on every tab mutation (the whole splitTree +
 * pinned sessionId per task) were WRITE-ONLY: nothing ever deleted them, so a
 * high-churn build/delete workflow (fan-out is the product's basic move) grew
 * one orphan snapshot per deleted task forever, and because kv-core reads and
 * rewrites the whole file, every leftover key taxed every later tab write.
 * The web side already does the symmetric cleanup (kobe-web tabs.ts), so this
 * is a TUI-side gap, not a design choice.
 *
 * Two pure operations over a minimal kv surface (`set(key, undefined)` deletes
 * — kv-core's explicit-undefined serialization). Framework-free so both live
 * under vitest with a fake kv.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — hook on DELETE only: deleting a task destroys its
 * worktree/branch/history, so its tab snapshot is genuinely dead and safe to
 * reclaim.
