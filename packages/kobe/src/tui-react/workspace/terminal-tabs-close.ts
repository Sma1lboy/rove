/**
 * Close a tab of ANY task — mounted or not.
 *
 * The sidebar tree lists every worktree's tabs, so "close this tab" can name a
 * task whose `TerminalTabs` is not on screen and therefore owns no React state
 * to update. Two routes, one entry point:
 *
 *   - **Mounted** — hand the request to the component (it holds the state, the
 *     kv write, and the `tab.closed` plugin event) and let it do its own close.
 *   - **Not mounted** — write the module map + kv snapshot here and release the
 *     PTYs directly, the mirror of `appendBackgroundEngineTab`.
 *
 * Which one applies is not guessed: `requestTabClose` notifies the listener set
 * synchronously, so a request that is still pending afterwards was claimed by
 * nobody. That keeps the two paths from ever both firing.
 *
 * Split from `terminal-tabs-shared.ts` so that module keeps its narrow import
 * surface — this one reaches into the PTY registry and the split helper.
