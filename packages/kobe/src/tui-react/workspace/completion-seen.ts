/**
 * Durable "I already looked at this completion" record — the persisted half
 * of the sidebar's unread lamp (● turn done, not yet viewed).
 *
 * The lamp's seen bit used to live ONLY in a process-local Set, so quitting
 * kobe threw the fact away while the daemon kept publishing the very same
 * `turn_complete` (its activity registry is daemon-lived, not TUI-lived).
 * Every completion you had already read came back unread on the next launch
 * — owner report 2026-08-12, issue #22.
 *
 * The mark is the completion's own timestamp: `turn_complete` is a STICKY
 * activity state, so its `at` is stamped once by the reporting event and
 * only a new event restamps it. Recording "seen up to `at`" per (task, tab)
 * therefore reads exactly right across restarts — an older completion is
 * read, a newer one is not — with no way for a stale entry to swallow a
 * fresh turn.
 *
 * Framework-free so the row cards, the tree's tab rows and unit tests share
 * one rule; the KV layer just persists the record.
