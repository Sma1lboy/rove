/**
 * Scratch temp shell tasks (issue #33) — the host-side lifecycle wiring:
 *
 *   - `openScratchShell` (ctrl+e dialog's trailing "scratch shell" choice —
 *     the prefix+t chord was rejected, owner 2026-08-16): create a scratch
 *     dir task rooted at $HOME and enter it. The task's tab-1 spawns as a
 *     bare shell (TerminalTabs' scratch mode); the row lives in the
 *     sidebar's Scratch section.
 *   - `onScratchExit`: the last shell exited — delete the row outright,
 *     zero ceremony (no confirm; a scratch task owns no
 *     worktree/branch, deletion only drops the index entry). Deliberately
 *     UNFORCED: `kind: "dir"` already skips the dirty gate and never removes
 *     the directory, so `force` here would only be a standing licence to
 *     destroy a real worktree if the row's kind ever changed.
 *   - the fold finish (issue #40): the adoption loop moved the shell's
 *     sessions under an existing task — quietly re-point selection to the
 *     folded tab (ONLY when the scratch row was the selected one; a
 *     background fold must not move the user), then delete the emptied
 *     row. Deletion AFTER the rename, so the daemon's task-snapshot pty
 *     sweep sees the sessions under a live task id and spares them.
 *
 * The adoption loop (cwd + harness → project migration) is its own hook,
 * `use-scratch-adopt.ts`.
