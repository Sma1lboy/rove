 * Poll the pty host's session inventory for the sidebar tree's orphan-tab

 *
 * Deliberately a POLL, not a subscription: the host publishes `pty.data` to
 * ATTACHED connections only, and the whole point here is the sessions this
 * TUI never attached to. `pty.list` is a cheap in-memory read on the host,
 * and sessions appear on human timescales — the same 2s cadence the live
 * engine probe already runs at is far more than enough.
 *
 * Every failure mode resolves to "no orphans": no host running, an older
 * host without the verb, a socket that dies mid-call. The backstop only ever
 * ADDS rows, so being wrong costs a missing row, never a phantom one.
