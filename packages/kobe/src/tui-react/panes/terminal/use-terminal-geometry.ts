/**
 * Body-box geometry measurement for the embedded terminal pane (React port of
 * the measurement half of the Solid original).
 *
 * The seam is ordering, and the import graph pins it: this hook measures
 * BEFORE the PTY exists, so its `bodyGeometry` can feed `useTerminalPty`. The
 * resize-push-to-pty and host-cursor-anchor effects stay in `Terminal.tsx`
 * because they need the PTY handle and the computed viewport cursor, which
 * only exist afterwards — nothing here may depend on either, or the pane
 * cannot boot at its real size.
 *
 * Measures the rendered body box (before spawning the PTY) so a fresh pane
 * boots at its real size instead of the 80x24 default — booting small
 * then immediately resizing makes zsh/starship-style prompts redraw into
 * stray standalone lines.
 *
 * `bodyEl` MUST be React state (not a plain ref) — the measurement effect
 * needs to re-run the instant the box ref is attached, mirroring the
 * Solid original's `bodyRef()` signal read (tracked, so setting the ref
 * re-fires the effect on first layout). A plain `useRef` would silently
 * skip that first measurement.
