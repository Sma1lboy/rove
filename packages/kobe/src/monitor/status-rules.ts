/**
 * Daemon-side status rules (docs/design/web-kanban.md M5, revised
 * 2026-06-11: the small-model judge was dropped in favor of rule + agent
 * self-report).
 *
 * The one rule that needs no judgment: an engine STARTING a turn on a
 * `backlog` task means work has begun — `turn-start` is unambiguous, so a
 * pure rule advances the card to `in_progress`. The other half of the flow
 * (in_progress → in_review) is the agent's own self-report via the injected
 * status protocol (engine/interactive-command.ts `withStatusProtocol`); the
 * agent knows whether it finished, no external classifier needed.
 *
 * Guardrails (the auto-done incident is the cautionary tale): the ONLY
 * transition this rule makes is `backlog → in_progress`. A task the user
 * placed anywhere else is never touched, so dragging a card back to
 * Backlog mid-session sticks until the engine's NEXT turn starts. Opt-in
 * via state.json `experimental.autoStatus`, read per event.
