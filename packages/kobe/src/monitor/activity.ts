/**
 * Engine-conversation activity probe for the Ops pane.
 *
 * v0.6 hands the interactive surface to tmux, so the monitor has no chat
 * stream to learn "the agent finished a turn" from — and parsing the
 * tmux pane is explicitly off the table (fragile, racy). Instead we read
 * the engine's OWN transcript store, the same on-disk JSONL the cost
 * dashboard and auto-title already use, and watch its mtime: when the
 * newest transcript for a worktree advances, the agent wrote new
 * conversation output. The Ops pane (`kobe ops`) polls this per task and
 * lights a corner badge.
 *
 * Each engine owns "where its transcripts live + which one is newest"
 * (`EngineHistoryReader.latestTranscriptMtimeForWorktree`); this module
 * is only a thin convenience over the engine registry, kept so the Ops
 * pane's import stays put.
