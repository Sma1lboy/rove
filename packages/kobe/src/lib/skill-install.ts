/**
 * Install + detect the kobe agent skill.
 *
 * The skill teaches a coding agent when and how to drive `kobe api` (the
 * full task-lifecycle CLI). Installation runs through the Vercel Labs
 * agent-skills CLI (`npx skills add`), which owns the part that is genuinely
 * hard to maintain: the registry of ~75 coding agents, where each one reads
 * its skills from, which get a real directory vs a symlink into the shared
 * `.agents/skills`. kobe does NOT reimplement any of that.
 *
 * What Rove changes is the packaged SOURCE. The public fallback is the
 * canonical `Sma1lboy/rove` repository; `--skill rove` selects the skill.
 * Cloning the repository
 * (`git clone --depth 1`) means a huge working tree just to deliver one
 * SKILL.md, which is effectively un-installable on a slow connection. But a
 * user running `kobe skill install` already HAS kobe, and the skill ships
 * inside the npm package, so the CLI is pointed at that local copy instead:
 * {@link bundledSkillDir}. No clone, no network. The published repo slug
 * stays available as {@link SKILL_SOURCE_SLUG} for people without kobe.
 *
 * Reliable check: `kobe skill status`. The startup hint
 * here is best-effort (the opentui screen takeover can scroll it off).
 * Absent skill → one-shot hint, never nags. Stale skill on an interactive
 * terminal → a yes / no / don't-notify-this-version prompt (runs before the
 * screen takeover); "no" re-asks next launch, "don't notify" mutes that
 * skill version, non-TTY falls back to the old one-shot hint.
