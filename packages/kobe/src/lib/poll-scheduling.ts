/**
 * Pure scheduling core for subprocess-backed background polling, kept out
 * of `src/tui/lib/background-poll.ts` so the
 * daemon's worktree-changes collector can reuse the EXACT guards that
 * keep huge-repo `git status` off the event loop, without importing
 * UI state primitives into daemon code.
 *
 * The three guards live here; the two bindings differ only in where a
 * finished value goes:
 *
 *   - **in-flight dedupe** — one run per key at a time
 *     ({@link shouldPoll}); ticks landing mid-run are dropped.
 *   - **adaptive cadence** — the next run is allowed only after
 *     `max(minIntervalMs, 5 × last duration)` ({@link computeNextAllowedAt}):
 *     fast repos keep the tick cadence, slow-but-finishing repos self-thin.
 *   - **timeout + hard backoff** — a run exceeding `timeoutMs` is aborted
 *     (children spawned via {@link spawnCapture} get SIGKILLed) and the key
 *     backs off for `slowRetryMs`.
 *
 * `src/tui/lib/background-poll.ts` re-exports everything here, so its
 * public API is unchanged; TUI code keeps importing from there.
 * Dependency-free apart from `node:child_process` — safe for the daemon,
 * vitest, and any render process.
