/**
 * Standalone-binary build entry.
 *
 * Produces the compiled `rove` binary for the *current platform* via
 * `Bun.build({ compile: true })`:
 *
 *   ./release-bin/rove
 *
 * Output lives outside `./dist/` on purpose: `dist/` is what `npm
 * publish` ships, and embedding a 60+ MB executable into the npm
 * tarball would bloat installs that only need the JS bundle.
 *
 * Cross-compilation is intentionally not used. `@opentui/core` loads
 * `@opentui/core-${platform}-${arch}` via a runtime template-literal
 * import; the matching native subpackage ships with platform/cpu
 * restrictions in its package.json, so npm/bun won't install a foreign
 * one on the host. Each release matrix runner therefore builds for its
 * own platform — no `target:` override here.
 *
 * Unlike `build.ts`, `@opentui/core` is *not* external: `--compile`
 * needs to embed the bundled core (and thus the matching native
 * subpackage) into the executable's VFS. `node-pty` stays external; the web
 * dashboard ships in the npm `dist/web-ui` artifact, not inside the compiled
 * single-file binary.
 *
 * After the kobed → kobe bin merge (KOB-136), the single Rove binary
 * also hosts the daemon (`rove daemon start|stop|status|restart`), so
 * there is no separate `kobed` binary to compile.
