# preview-install — overwrite the globally-installed PROD Rove with THIS
# checkout's build, for local testing only.
#
# Usage:  scripts/preview-install.sh        (from anywhere in the repo)
#
# What it does:
#   1. builds the current tree with the version baked as
#      `<version>-preview.<shortsha>` (CURRENT_VERSION reads package.json
#      at compile time, so `rove -v` and the TUI update chip both say
#      "preview", and the published prod release always compares newer),
#   2. deletes the global install's dist/ and copies this build in,
#   3. patches the global package.json to the preview version.
#
# Going back to prod is the NORMAL update path — nothing special:
#   rove update        (npm/bun reinstall @latest overwrites everything
#                       this script touched)
#
# Ceiling (ponytail): only dist/ is copied — if the dev tree changed the
# package's runtime *dependencies* since the installed prod release, the
# preview may crash on a missing module. Run `rove update` first so the
# global dep tree is current, then preview-install again.
