// Per-touched-file coverage gate (the coverage sibling of ci.yml's
// file-size-cap job). Philosophy: no global % threshold — a repo-wide bar
// invites filler tests. Instead, every code file a PR TOUCHES must meet a
// line-coverage floor, so coverage ratchets up exactly where work happens:
// touch it → you test it.
//
// Inputs (env):
//   BASE_REF            PR base branch (required) — diff is origin/BASE...HEAD
//   PR_BODY             PR description; `coverage-exemption: <path> — <reason>` lines exempt the named files
//   KOBE_COVERAGE_MIN   line-% floor for touched files (default 50)
//   KOBE_RENDER_COVERAGE 1 selects bun test's OpenTUI lcov report
//
// Default mode expects packages/kobe/coverage/coverage-summary.json to exist
// (`cd packages/kobe && bun run coverage` first). Render mode
// (`KOBE_RENDER_COVERAGE=1`) consumes test:render's lcov instead. A touched
// source file that is ABSENT from its applicable report counts as 0% — an
// untested new module fails loudly instead of slipping through.
//
// SUBPROCESS_ONLY_EXCLUSIONS below (KOB-11) is a small, hand-verified list of
// entry files exercised only by test/behavior/'s spawned dist-CLI subprocess
// (vitest's v8 coverage can't attribute a child process) — not a general
// escape hatch, see the comment at its definition.
