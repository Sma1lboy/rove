# Cut a Rove release from pending changesets.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release.sh        # consume .changeset/*.md → version + CHANGELOG → commit + tag + push
#
# The bump (patch/minor/major) is NOT passed here — it comes from the pending
# changeset files. Add changesets while you work with `bun run changeset`; see
# docs/RELEASING.md.
#
# What it does:
#   0. Verify local main == origin/main. A release publishes what CI builds
#      from the pushed tag, so unpushed commits (never PR-reviewed) and a
#      stale local tree are both refused. Unrelated UNCOMMITTED files are
#      only reported — they can't reach the tag, and blocking on them froze
#      releases whenever another session had work in progress.
#   1. Gate: lint, typecheck, test, build, behavior — the same set
#      `release.yml` makes `publish` wait on, so a gate the tag would fail on
#      fails HERE instead, while the version number is still reusable. Any
#      failure aborts before touching version/CHANGELOG — a red tree never
#      gets tagged. Runs against the working tree as a fast fail; `release.yml`
#      re-runs everything from the tag checkout before publishing.
#   2. `changeset version` — derives the next version from pending changesets,
#      rewrites packages/kobe/package.json, prepends notes to CHANGELOG.md, and
#      deletes the consumed changesets.
#   3. `bun install` — refreshes bun.lock after the package version changed,
#      then `bun install --frozen-lockfile` verifies the lockfile is complete.
#   4. Biome `--write` on the regenerated package.json / CHANGELOG.md so the
#      reserialized JSON can't fail the lint gate (the `files` array used to
#      re-expand to multi-line and break `biome check`).
#   5. Commits "chore: release — X.Y.Z". The tag is NOT created yet.
#   6. Asks, then pushes the release COMMIT to main and waits for its CI run
#      (ci.yml on ubuntu/macos — the same job set release.yml makes `publish`
#      wait on) to go green. Only THEN tags vX.Y.Z and pushes the tag, which
#      triggers the publish. Local gates run on this (macOS) machine, so a
#      Linux-only red reaches CI first — under the old order that red arrived
#      AFTER the tag and burned the version number (v0.8.58, v0.8.66). Now a
#      red release commit leaves no tag: land the fix on main and re-run this
#      script — it detects the committed-but-untagged version and RESUMES
#      (wait for CI at the fixed HEAD → tag the same vX.Y.Z → push).

# ── two-phase tag: wait for the release commit's CI, then tag + push ─────────

# (ubuntu + macos), which the local gate on this machine cannot prove
# (platform-dependent reds: v0.8.66's darwin-only test path). ci.yml's
# main-push jobs (typecheck-and-test, behavior, render-track,
# visual-ground-truth) are the same set release.yml makes `publish` wait on.

# result green or red in ways the tag's own content wouldn't. That's a
