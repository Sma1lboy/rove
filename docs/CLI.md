# CLI reference

Everything the `rove` and `kobe` binaries do. The scriptable surface for agents and
scripts has its own page: [`rove api`](./API.md).

Two things stay authoritative if this page and the binary ever disagree:
`rove --help` for the command list, and `rove api schema` for the `rove api`
surface.

## Install and update

Needs git and at least one engine CLI on `PATH`. The CLI runs on the Bun
runtime (≥ 1.3.11); each route below installs Bun for you when it is missing.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://rove.sma1lboy.me/install.sh | sh   # installs Bun, then Rove
npm install -g @sma1lboy/rove                         # npm (asks about Bun on first run)
bun install -g @sma1lboy/rove                         # bun
npx @sma1lboy/rove                                    # try without installing
```

The `rove` and `kobe` bins are small launchers: they run the CLI directly when
started by Bun, and find (or offer to install) a Bun when started by node —
which is what `npm install -g` and `npx` do. Two environment variables steer
that: `ROVE_BUN` names the Bun binary to use, `ROVE_NO_BUN_BOOTSTRAP=1` turns a
missing Bun into a plain error instead of an install offer.

The installed package exposes both `rove` and `kobe`. `rove` is the canonical
entry point; `kobe` remains a fully supported compatibility alias. They run the
same commands against the same daemon, worktrees, and persisted state. This
rename uses `~/.rove` and `~/.config/rove/state.json` for canonical product
data. First launch copies supported legacy data without overwriting or removing
the old files; runtime and plugin paths retain their compatibility names.

```bash
rove update            # latest
rove update 0.7.90     # pin a version
rove update list       # browse recent versions
rove update dry-run    # print the command without running it
```

rove updates using whichever package manager owns the `rove` on your `PATH`,
so the new version can't land in a shadowed prefix. Manual fallback:
`npm install -g @sma1lboy/rove@latest`.

Some versions are marked breaking. Installing across one prints a heads-up,
and the next launch asks you to run `rove reset` first. Worktrees are never
touched.

## Launching

```bash
rove            # the TUI (first run: onboarding wizard)
rove .          # open a directory as a task — the `code .` gesture
rove web        # the browser dashboard on http://localhost:45174
```

A typo never silently opens the TUI: an unknown subcommand prints usage and
exits 2.

## Managing projects

```bash
rove add [path]      # save a repo for the new-task picker (defaults to .)
rove remove [path]   # forget it — files, worktrees, and tasks all stay
rove adopt [glob] [--repo <path>] [--vendor <engine>] [--yes]
                     # list/import existing git worktrees as tasks
```

`rove add` needs a real git repo. It creates the project's sidebar row and
folds in any existing unlinked worktrees as tasks.

`rove adopt` scans the current repo by default; `--repo <path>` selects another
one and `--vendor <engine>` chooses the engine recorded on imported tasks. With
no glob it is a dry run that lists what it would import; pass a glob to filter
(`rove adopt 'feature-*'`) and `--yes` / `-y` to actually do it.

**Remote projects** (experimental — enable Settings → Dev → Experimental
first) can register an SSH host and create task worktrees there:

```bash
rove add --remote --host <host> --user <user> --path <basePath> \
         [--port N] [--key [path] | --password]
```

Auth is either `--key` (ssh-agent when you omit the path) or `--password`.
Password auth is **macOS-only today**: Rove prompts for it and stores only a
reference in `state.json`; the secret lives in the macOS keychain. Linux and
Windows reject `--password`, so use a key or ssh-agent there.

This is not remote-execution parity yet. Remote worktree creation is wired,
but the current Hosted PTY engine launcher does not wrap the engine command in
SSH. A remote-only worktree path therefore cannot be treated like a supported
local engine cwd, and engine launch may fail. Files/diffs and repo init also
lack full remote parity. Do not use this experiment as a security boundary or
assume prompts, engine execution, or repository reads are confined to the SSH
host.

## web

```bash
rove web [--port <n>] [--routes-only] [--no-takeover]
```

Serves the dashboard on `:45174`, plus a sidecar for browser terminal tabs.
`--routes-only` starts/verifies only the daemon-hosted HTTP/SSE routes, for a
separate Vite dev server. Normally Rove may replace an older Rove PTY sidecar
on `<port + 2>`; `--no-takeover` disables that replacement and never probes or
kills the prior sidecar.

`ROVE_DAEMON_WEB_PORT` is read when the **daemon starts** (`0`/`off`/`false`
disables its web transport). It is not a substitute for `rove web --port`:
`rove web` targets `45174` unless `--port` is present. Neither setting can
rebind a daemon that is already running; after changing the daemon port, run
`rove daemon restart`, then pass the same port to `rove web`.

## completions

```bash
source <(rove completions zsh)
rove completions bash > ~/.bash_completion.d/rove
rove completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/rove.fish
```

Completes subcommands; each subcommand owns its own flags.

## export

```bash
rove export [--json | --csv | --format <json|csv|table>]
```

Prints your task list. Read-only and **works with the daemon down**, which is
what makes it different from `rove api list`. Columns: `id, title, status,
archived, vendor, branch, repo, worktreePath`. Default is JSON; `--format
table` aligns it for humans.

## config

```bash
rove config [--path]
```

Opens `~/.config/rove/state.json` in your editor. See
[Configuration](./CONFIGURATION.md).

## theme

```bash
rove theme list
rove theme add <url|path> [--name <name>] [--force]
rove theme remove <name>
```

User themes land in `~/.rove/themes/` and can shadow a bundled name. Bundled
themes can't be removed. See [Themes](./themes.md).

## repo

```bash
rove repo show [path]
rove repo set [path] --init-script <text> | --init-script-file <path>
                    [--init-prompt <text> | --init-prompt-file <path>]
rove repo unset [path] [--init-script] [--init-prompt]
```

Sets a per-user init override for a repo. If the repo commits its own
`.rove/init.sh` / `.rove/init-prompt.md`, those win. Legacy `.kobe` files are
field-by-field fallbacks. Path defaults to the current directory. `unset` with
no flag clears both.

## skill

```bash
rove skill install [--global|-g | --project|-p] [--agent NAME]…
rove skill status
rove skill command [--global|-g | --project|-p] [--agent NAME]…
                                                   # print, don't run
rove skill print                                 # print the SKILL.md itself
```

Installs the Rove agent skill — what teaches a coding agent to drive
`rove api`. Installs are **global** (user-level) by default: the skill
drives a machine-wide daemon, so one copy per machine keeps one staleness
lifecycle; `--project` / `-p` installs into the current project instead.
`--global` / `-g` restates the default explicitly. With no `--agent` it
detects your installed agents and asks. To name them yourself, repeat the flag
(`--agent claude-code --agent codex`; `--agent=codex` also works); a
comma-joined list is rejected rather than silently using only the first.

The skill ships inside the npm package, so nothing is downloaded.

`rove --skill` (top-level flag) is shorthand for `rove skill print`: it dumps
the bundled SKILL.md to stdout so an agent can learn the `rove api` surface in
one command — e.g. prompt your agent with ``read `rove --skill` then fan out
tasks``, no pre-installed skill required.

## plugin

```text
rove plugin install <owner/repo[/subdir]> [--yes] [--ref <rev>]
rove plugin link <dir>                         register a local directory (dev)
rove plugin list                               installed + linked plugins
rove plugin search [query]                     browse the marketplace
rove plugin outdated                           check installs against upstream
rove plugin update <id…> | --all [--yes]       reinstall stale plugins
rove plugin enable <id> | disable <id>         toggle without unregistering
rove plugin unlink <id>                        unregister a linked plugin
rove plugin uninstall <id-or-spec>             unregister + remove the checkout
rove plugin config-dir <id>                    print its config directory
rove plugin log <id> [-n <count>]              tail its command log
rove plugin action list [--plugin <id>]
rove plugin action invoke <plugin-id.action-id> [args…]
rove plugin pane open <plugin-id.pane-id> [--task <task-id>]
```

Changes apply to a running daemon without a restart. Writing one:
[Plugin authoring](./PLUGIN-AUTHORING.md). Marketplace:
<https://github.com/topics/rove-plugin>. Repositories carrying the legacy
`kobe-plugin` topic remain included.

## doctor

```bash
rove doctor [--report]
```

Read-only check of your build, terminal, git, engine CLIs and logins, daemon,
running sessions, agent skill, and state files. Never changes anything.
`--report` also writes a bug bundle (diagnosis + recent logs + env) and
prints its path — attach that to bug reports. See
[Troubleshooting](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## reset

```bash
rove reset [--hard] [--yes]
```

Recovers a wedged install: stops the daemon and the PTY host (ending all
background sessions). **Never touches git worktrees.** `--hard` also deletes
your task index and UI state. Asks for confirmation unless `--yes`.

## daemon

```bash
rove daemon status     # status JSON; exit 1 when nothing is running
rove daemon start      # run in the FOREGROUND (this process becomes it)
rove daemon stop
rove daemon restart    # stop, then respawn in the background
```

The daemon auto-starts when the TUI or `rove api` needs it, so `start` is
mainly for debugging. Logs are at `~/.rove/daemon.log` — read them first when
something's wrong.

> **Working on Rove itself?** Run `rove daemon restart` after editing
> daemon/orchestrator/engine code. Bun doesn't hot-reload.

## feedback

```bash
rove feedback --title <text> (--body <text> | --body-file <path>) [--category <slug>]
```

Opens a GitHub Discussion via the `gh` CLI (needs `gh auth login`).
`--body-file -` reads from stdin.

## Internal subcommands

Not in `--help`, listed so they aren't a mystery if you see them:

- **`rove pty-host`** — the process that owns embedded terminals so they
  survive TUI exits and daemon restarts. Spawned automatically.
- **`rove hook <verb>`** — fired by an engine's own hooks to report activity.
  It always exits 0 and never starts the daemon, so it can't fail your engine.
  One verb is user-facing: **`rove hook cleanup`** removes Rove's
  settings-managed hooks from `~/.claude/settings.json` after the Claude Code
  plugin takes over — see
  [Configuration → Claude Code plugin](CONFIGURATION.md#claude-code-plugin).

## Exit codes

- **0** — success, including "already in that state" (`daemon stop` with no
  daemon).
- **1** — runtime failure: `rove add` on a non-repo, no editor found, no
  daemon for `daemon status`, plugin errors.
- **2** — bad invocation: unknown command, verb, or flag; missing value.
  Always comes with usage text.

`rove api` is the JSON-first surface (JSON on stdout, a JSON error envelope on
stderr). Everything else prints human text — for machine-readable task data
without a daemon, use `rove export --json`.

## Environment variables

`ROVE_*` is the canonical spelling. Every one of these also accepts the
established `KOBE_*` name as a compatibility alias, and `ROVE_*` wins when both
are set — `ROVE_HOME_DIR` beats `KOBE_HOME_DIR`, `ROVE_OPEN_EDITOR` beats
`KOBE_OPEN_EDITOR`, and so on for the whole table.

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ROVE_HOME_DIR` | Move Rove's home-rooted task/runtime data; platform settings and engine-owned history keep their own locations |
| `ROVE_OPEN_EDITOR` | Command that opens a worktree in a GUI editor (`code`, `cursor`, …) |
| `ROVE_DAEMON_WEB_PORT` | Daemon web-transport port at daemon startup (default 45174; `0`/`off`/`false` disables). `rove web` itself uses `--port`. |
| `ROVE_DEV=1` | Mark a developer checkout — hides the update chip |
| `ROVE_DEBUG=1` | Print full startup errors instead of one line |
| `ROVE_TASK_ID` / `ROVE_TAB_ID` | Set inside tabs Rove opens; how `rove api` verbs resolve the calling task |

The `KOBE_*` aliases stay fully supported: engine hooks and older automation
keep reading `KOBE_TASK_ID` / `KOBE_TAB_ID`, which Rove exports beside the
canonical names.

`ROVE_OPEN_EDITOR` wins over Rove's auto-detection, and it's separate from the
`editor.*` settings, which pick your TTY editor.

## Where state lives

Canonical product data under `~/.rove/` (or `ROVE_HOME_DIR`, with
`KOBE_HOME_DIR` as fallback):

- `tasks.json` — the task index
- `worktrees/<repo-key>/<task-slug>/` — per-task worktrees
- `themes/`, `settings/keybindings.yaml`, issues, notes, and automations

Plus `~/.config/rove/state.json`, the settings file `rove config` or
`kobe config` opens. Existing `~/.kobe/worktrees` paths remain recognized and
are never copied or rewritten. Daemon/PTY runtime files and `plugins.json` +
`plugins/<id>/` deliberately remain under `~/.kobe` for continuity. The first
launch copies other supported legacy data additively and never deletes the
source or overwrites canonical files. Daemon-owned stores are copied at
new-daemon startup, only after the legacy writer has stopped.
