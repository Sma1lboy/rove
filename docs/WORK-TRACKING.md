# Local work tracking

rove work is tracked locally. There is no external issue tracker. Agents should not file or update tickets in any external system, or require its CLI authentication, during normal development.

## Sources of truth

- **Backlog + open issues**: daemon-owned issue state.
- **Current risks and follow-ups**: [`../HANDOFF.md`](../HANDOFF.md).
- **User-facing shipped behavior**: [`../packages/kobe/CHANGELOG.md`](../packages/kobe/CHANGELOG.md).
- **Durable product and architecture decisions**: `docs/*.md`.
- **Proof of work**: git commits and test output.

## Issues / backlog: daemon issue store

The daemon owns active issue state so web edits and agent automation see the
same data from every worktree. Deliberately low-ceremony: no type taxonomy,
just a `status`. The persisted daemon file is keyed by each repo's git
common-dir, so the source checkout and its worktrees share one issue record:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "repos": {
    "/path/to/repo/.git": {
      "repoRoot": "/path/to/repo",
      "nextId": 4,
      "issues": [
        { "id": 1, "title": "short imperative title", "status": "open", "created": "YYYY-MM-DD", "body": "context, repro, scope; one field, free text" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

- **`status`**: `open` → `doing` → `done`, plus `hold` for issues parked on purpose (waiting on a decision, blocked, deliberately deferred). `hold` is a parking lot, not a lifecycle step. Resume by flipping back to `open`. The archive sweep ignores it (only `done` moves), so held issues stay visible in the active file. Status is still the only dimension; don't add label/type fields.
- **`id`**: take `nextId`, then increment `nextId`. Ids are never reused.
- **Adding**: use the web Issues page or `rove api issue-create --repo <path> --title ...`. The daemon stores the repo's issue record under the repo's git common-dir, so a source checkout and its task worktrees share the same issues.
- **Closing**: flip `status` to `done`. Done issues stay visible in the Done column until a future archive/export flow exists.
- **Agent automation**: use `rove api issue-list`, `rove api issue-create`, `rove api issue-set-status`, and `rove api issue-update`. From a task worktree, `--repo .` resolves to the same daemon issue record as the source checkout.
- **Web panel**: the `rove web` dashboard's Issues page proxies `/api/issues` to daemon `issue.*` RPCs (status flips incl. `hold`, new issues, one-click quick-start of a Rove task from an issue).

Code changes still land their user-facing line as a **Changeset** (see [`RELEASING.md`](./RELEASING.md)). Issues are the *backlog of what to do*, the changelog is the *record of what shipped*. They're different things; an issue often closes by landing a change that carries its own changeset.

## Local workflow

1. Read `HANDOFF.md` and the relevant docs before editing.
2. Check `git status --short` so user changes are not mistaken for agent changes.
3. Make a focused change.
4. Run the applicable checks from `docs/HARNESS.md`.
5. Add a Changeset for user-visible package behavior; the release workflow
   updates `CHANGELOG.md`. Do not edit the generated changelog by hand.
6. Commit when green, using the repository commit rules from `AGENTS.md`.

## Recording follow-ups

Use repo-local artifacts instead of external tickets:

- Backlog / "we should do X" items go in the daemon issue tracker.
- Immediate operational notes for the next session go in `HANDOFF.md`.
- Durable design notes go in `docs/`.
- Release-facing changes go in a Changeset → `CHANGELOG.md`.

If a future request needs external tracking again, ask the user first. Do not file external tickets automatically.
