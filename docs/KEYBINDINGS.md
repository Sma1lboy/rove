# Keybindings

**Press `F1` inside Rove** for the live, localized keymap, including your own
overrides. This page is the stable vocabulary and behavior reference.

## How keys work

Two things decide what a key does:

- **Where.** A key is either Rove-wide, or owned by the focused pane.
- **How.** One press, or the prefix followed by a second key.

Which gives you three patterns:

| Pattern | Example | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Bare letter | `n`, `a`, `d` | Actions in the focused pane |
| One press | `ctrl+t`, `ctrl+w` | Frequent Rove-wide actions |
| Prefix sequence | `ctrl+a` then `i` | Everything less frequent |

Inside the embedded engine terminal, unclaimed keys go straight to the engine;
Rove only reserves its explicit chords. The prefix still works there, so
the command menu is reachable from every pane. Press `ctrl+q` to leave the
terminal without opening it.

Tap the configured prefix once to open the command layer. By default, Rove
opens the complete command guide and also shows shortcuts beside clickable
controls already on screen, such as **New task**, **Inbox**, **Kanban**,
**Automations**, **Zen**, **Ask agent to create PR**, and **Settings**. In **Settings →
Keybindings → Prefix tap**, choose **Complete guide only** to hide the on-screen
badges while keeping the guide.

Both the badges and guide read the live keymap. A rebound prefix or action
changes immediately, and an unbound or currently unreachable action is not
advertised. Clicking a guide row rechecks the current pane and modal scope
before it runs. The setting changes only whether the pending command layer also
marks controls in place. Both choices use the same prefix, second stroke,
timeout, pane scope, and cancellation rules. No hold or key-release support is
required.

## The prefix

The default first stroke is `ctrl+a`. Tap it, then press one more key within
5 seconds. A complete on-screen command map appears after a short pause and
shows only actions that can run right now.

| Sequence | Action |
|---|---|
| `ctrl+a` `f` | New-conversation dialog, preset to "fork a child task": new managed worktree, branched off this Task's branch |
| `ctrl+a` `c` | New-conversation dialog, preset to "continue this chat" in a new tab of the same Task directory |
| `ctrl+a` `i` | Open the Inbox |
| `ctrl+a` `h` / `l` | Move focus left / right across panes |
| `ctrl+a` `o` | Open the Task directory in your editor |
| `ctrl+a` `m` | Reorder sidebar rows (scope-aware: tab / task / project) |
| `ctrl+a` `w` | Close the active split |
| `ctrl+a` `1` / `2` / `3` | Kanban / Automations / GitHub Issues |
| `ctrl+a` `z` | Toggle zen mode |
| `ctrl+a` `,` | Open Settings |
| `ctrl+a` `p` / `P` | Create a PR from the active task |

`ctrl+a` `c` picks an engine first. Claude and Codex can fork their own
conversations natively. Copilot and Kimi use a transcript handoff even for a
same-engine continuation; a built-in source can also hand off to a different
built-in or custom target. A custom source has no readable transcript, so its
continuation is refused. See [Engines](./ENGINES.md#resuming-and-forking).

The sequence cancels on timeout, `esc`, an invalid second key, or a change of
focus or dialog.

## One-press keys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `F1` | The live keymap; works from every pane, including inside the terminal (not while a dialog or a full-page view — Settings / Worktrees / Update — is open) |
| `ctrl+q` | Focus the sidebar; pressed again there, quit immediately (`q` in the sidebar quits with a confirm) |
| `ctrl+t` | New engine tab |
| `ctrl+e` | New-conversation dialog with the engine/shell picker; inside it, `←`/`→` (or `h`/`l`) pick the engine and `enter` confirms, `tab` switches the destination (new tab here ⇄ fork a child task) and `ctrl+f` the context (fresh ⇄ continue this chat). The trailing "scratch shell" choice opens a Scratch shell task |
| `ctrl+w` | Close the active split, otherwise the tab |
| `ctrl+[` / `ctrl+]` | Previous / next tab |
| `ctrl+\` | Split right |
| `ctrl+=` | Split down |
| `ctrl+2` … `ctrl+9`, `ctrl+0` | Jump to the Nth visible sidebar row (`ctrl+2` = first row) |
| `F2` | Rename the active split, otherwise the tab |
| `F3` | Focus the next split |
| `F4` | Cycle focus forward |
| `F5` | Confirm and reset the active terminal |
| `F7` | Jump to the next Inbox item across all projects |

Overlap resolves by context: `ctrl+w` closes the innermost split when a tab
is split, otherwise the tab. `F2` follows the same rule.

Both split chords need a terminal speaking the kitty keyboard protocol
(legacy terminals can't encode `ctrl+=`, and `ctrl+\` would be SIGQUIT);
reserving `ctrl+\` also costs the embedded shell its SIGQUIT.

**Jump digits.** There is no `ctrl+1`; the terminal protocol can't encode it,
so the first row answers to `2`.

## Sidebar and Files

Bare letters work only while that pane has focus and no dialog or text input
is active.

**Sidebar**

| Key | Action | | Key | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `n` | New task | | `r` | Rename |
| `enter` | Open | | `b` | Rename branch |
| `l` / `space` | Open the row under the cursor | | `v` | Change engine |
| `o` | Open Task directory in your editor | | `s` | Settings |
| `a` | Archive non-main Task | | `u` | Update page |
| `d` | Delete Task / forget project | | `/` | Search |
| `gg` / `shift+g` | Top / bottom | | `x` | Worktrees page |
| `shift+p` | Pin / unpin managed Task | | `right` | Focus the current engine pane |
| `shift+m` | Enter reorder mode (scope-aware: tab / task / project) | | | |

In reorder mode, `j`/`k` moves the highlighted project and `enter` or `esc`
finishes. Project headings themselves aren't cursor rows; the move routes
through a Task row in that project.

**Files**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` (or arrows) | Move |
| `h` / `l` (or `←`/`→`) | Collapse / expand |
| `enter` | Open in your configured editor; changed files use a Vim/Nvim diff when available, otherwise Rove falls back to its read-only preview |
| `d` | Open a read-only diff in a workspace tab without moving focus |
| `r` | Refresh the current file tab |
| `b` | On Changes, switch working-tree changes ⇄ branch vs base |
| `o` | Open audio, video, or PDF files in the system application |
| `a` | Insert an `@path` mention into the engine pane |
| `[` / `]` | Switch file tabs |

The sidebar is a tree (project → Task → Terminal Tab) and it never folds, so
everything is always visible. Search (`/`) matches titles, repos, branches,
and live tab titles, and keeps matching rows' parents so a hit is never
orphaned.

Right-click any row for its context menu; `j`/`k` and `⏎` drive it, and a press
anywhere else, or `esc`, dismisses it. Common row actions also have direct
chords. A Task or tab row also offers **New conversation** (the `ctrl+e`
engine/shell picker) and **New shell** (a bare shell tab) for that worktree,
both enter the Task first, exactly as pressing the chord there would. (If right-click opens your *terminal's* menu instead, see
[Troubleshooting](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md).)

## Terminal scrollback

These chords are trapped by Rove while the embedded terminal has focus; the
engine or shell does not receive them.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `ctrl+pageup` | Scroll one page up through buffered terminal output |
| `ctrl+pagedown` | Scroll one page down; reaching the bottom resumes following live output |

The mouse wheel uses the same scrollback. Buffer size is configured in
Settings → General → Terminal and applies to newly opened terminals.

## Inbox

`ctrl+a` `i` opens it. What the sections mean and how items clear:
[The TUI → Inbox](TUI.md#inbox).

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` (or arrows) | Select |
| `enter` | Open the target task and its exact tab when present, then clear the item |
| `d` | Clear an ATTENTION item without navigating |
| `esc` | Close |

## Diff review

In the read-only diff tab, with the workspace focused:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` (or arrows) | Move the line cursor |
| `v` | Anchor a range (`v` again cancels) |
| `c` | Write a note |
| `s` | Send all unsent notes to the engine |

These four are fixed and can't be rebound. The workflow:
[The TUI → Diff review](TUI.md#diff-review).

## Workspace pages

All of these pages close with `q`, `esc`, or `ctrl+c`. Their bare letters are
active only while the page has focus.

| Page | Keys |
|---|---|
| Kanban | arrows move between cards; `tab` changes project; `enter` opens details; `n` creates; `d` deletes; `r` refreshes |
| Automations | `j`/`k` select; `n` creates; `e` pauses/resumes; `s` runs now; `d` deletes; `r` refreshes; `enter` opens the latest run's Task |
| GitHub Issues | `j`/`k` select; `tab` changes repo; `a` toggles "assigned to me"; `r` refreshes; `enter` starts a Task |
| Worktrees | arrows select; `l` lands; `d` starts removal; see [Managing worktrees](WORKTREES.md) |
| Update | `j`/`k` selects an action; `u` updates; `r` opens the release page; `enter` runs the selected action |

In the Kanban story drawer, `tab` / `shift+tab` walks fields and `ctrl+enter`
activates its primary action: start an unlinked story or open the linked Task.
While creating a story, `ctrl+s` saves without starting and `esc` cancels.
In an existing story, `esc` saves edits and closes, while `ctrl+c` discards
them.

## Customizing

Edit `~/.rove/settings/keybindings.yaml`. Changes reload live, no restart.

```yaml
prefix:
  key: ctrl+a          # null disables prefix bindings
  timeoutMs: 5000
  bindings:
    chat.fork.new: f

bindings:
  chat.tab.new: ctrl+t
  chat.tab.chooseEngine: ctrl+e
  sidebar.select: [enter]
  files.createPR: null   # null or [] unbinds

darwin:                  # platform overlays win per chord
  bindings:
    files.openExternal: cmd+o
```

- A direct override **replaces** that binding's whole chord list.
- Prefix overrides set second-stroke keys and keep the binding's pane scope.
- Uppercase is a distinct chord: `shift+p` (or just `P`) can be bound apart
  from `p`. Shift with another modifier on a letter (`ctrl+shift+p`) is
  invalid; legacy terminals send the same byte either way.
- Unknown ids and invalid entries are ignored with a warning in
  Settings → Keybindings. A typo never breaks the default keymap.

### Plugin chords

Rove ships none; every plugin chord is your own choice:

```yaml
plugins:
  ctrl+g: pane:examples.lazygit.git
  f6: action:examples.notify.test
```

See [design/plugins.md](./design/plugins.md).
