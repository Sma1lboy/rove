# Keybinding decisions

The reasoning behind Rove's chord placements, newest first within each topic.
Chord placement is an **owner decision** (see the rule in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)); this file is where each resolution and its
reasoning is recorded so the next agent has the context.

The user-facing vocabulary lives in [`../KEYBINDINGS.md`](../KEYBINDINGS.md).
`F1` renders the live keymap and is authoritative over both.

## Repo context filter — removed, chord revoked

**2026-08-16 — `ctrl+p` repo filter removed entirely (owner call, same
turn as review).** PR #459 shipped a sidebar repo context filter on
`ctrl+p` (cycle all → each project → all). The owner rejected both the
chord (`ctrl+p` shadows readline/in-engine previous-history) and the
feature itself: the eventual "session" concept is a **combination of
repos**, not a single-repo filter, so a per-repo cycle is a shape that
would have to be undone anyway. Removed rather than re-homed behind the
prefix — YAGNI. If cross-repo grouping returns, it starts from the
session-as-repo-set design, not from this filter.

## Open calls

- **Inert table rows.** `sidebar.sort` (`t`), `sidebar.projectFilter`
  (`ctrl+p`), `sidebar.previewToggle` (`i`), and `tasks.toggleKeys` (`?`) are
  registered in the keymap table but have **no handler**, so pressing them
  does nothing today. F1 filters them out by reachability, so they aren't
  advertised either. Whether to wire them back or drop the rows is an open
  owner call.
  - For `sidebar.sort` specifically: a tree already carries an order (project
    → worktree → tab) and manual placement lives in move mode, so a second
    automatic ordering would only fight the structure. But the row was never
    removed and `activeSortMode` is still read at startup, so today the sort
    mode changes only by hand-editing `state.json`.
  - `sidebar.projectFilter`'s project filter was a fold, and the fold is gone.

## The unified new-conversation dialog

**2026-08-10 — one dialog for every "start a new chat" shape (issue #7),
owner-signed-off in the same turn.** Opening a conversation used to be four
chords spreading three orthogonal switches (destination × context × engine)
across separate flows. The resolution:

- **`ctrl+e` stays the direct entry and its default state is byte-for-byte
  the old picker**: engine list (+ shell + plugin panes), enter = fresh tab
  in this worktree. Existing muscle memory pays zero cost.
- **`tab` (in-dialog) toggles the destination** — new tab here ⇄ fork a
  child task worktree. `tab` is the natural "next option" key inside a
  dialog, is pane-passthrough (not a global chord) outside one, and the
  QuickTaskComposer already uses it for field cycling, so the vocabulary
  matches.
- **`ctrl+f` (in-dialog) toggles the context** — fresh ⇄ continue this
  conversation. `ctrl+f` ("fork") was `chat.fork.new`'s direct chord before
  #308 moved it to prefix-only, and it is STILL in
  `RESERVED_GLOBAL_CHORDS` (`keys-pure.ts`) — the embedded terminal
  swallows it rather than forwarding emacs forward-char to the engine CLI.
  Reusing it inside the dialog therefore collides with nothing: the PTY
  never saw it, no keymap row binds it directly, and dialog bindings sit
  above pane scope in the modal stack. The reservation stays so the byte
  doesn't change meaning with focus.
- **`ctrl+a` `c` and `ctrl+a` `f` survive as preset entries** into the same
  dialog — `c` pre-flips context to "continue" (this also resolves the
  former open call on `ctrl+a c`, now signed off), `f` pre-flips
  destination to "fork". One implementation, three doors; behavior on
  plain enter is unchanged from the old dedicated flows.
- **`ctrl+t` is untouched** — the zero-dialog fast path stays sacred.

The footer always shows both toggles' live state, so the dialog never
silently means something different from what it shows.

## The prefix

**2026-08-10 — the configured prefix first stroke is Kobe-owned even inside
the embedded terminal.** This makes the command layer and content-scoped
prefix actions reachable without leaving the pane. The explicit cost of the
default is that the terminal no longer receives `ctrl+a` for shell
line-start; disabling the prefix or rebinding it releases the old key to the
PTY immediately. Unlike fixed global chords, this reservation follows live
user configuration. A sequence armed outside the terminal still cancels when
focus crosses the PTY boundary, so a pending pane command cannot leak into
the engine accidentally.

**2026-08-09 — `f1` is reserved out of terminal passthrough**
(`RESERVED_GLOBAL_CHORDS`), so F1 opens the help reference from inside the
embedded terminal too. It was the one F-row gap (f2–f5, f7 were already
reserved), the docs promise "F1 anywhere", and the status-bar hint advertises
F1 inside the terminal — all three lied while f1 passed through. No engine
CLI binds F1.

## Rail pages take digits, not letters

**2026-08-01.** Kanban, Automations, and GitHub Issues are one kind of thing
— "point the content pane at X" — and their order on the rail is the
mnemonic. Kanban moved off the `c` it shipped with for that reason.

Rail pages do NOT disable the prefix: they replace only the content pane, so
`ctrl+a` `2` switches from one to another and `ctrl+a` `1` goes back without
an `esc` first. Their own bare keys (`j`/`k`/`d`/`enter`) are gated on the
content pane holding focus, so they never collide with the sidebar's
identically-named chords.

**Superseded history.** 2026-07-29: the Kanban left the bare sidebar `c` it
originally shipped with — the sidebar's bare letters are per-task verbs (new,
archive, delete, rename), while the Kanban is a step-back-and-look surface,
so it belonged with the other whole-page views reached through the prefix
(`prefix+i` Inbox). Going global also meant it opened from any pane instead
of only under sidebar focus. It took `prefix+c` (cards) for two days, then
moved to `prefix+1` when the rail made it row 1 of a set.

## Focus navigation

**2026-07-25 — focus movement is a cursor, not a ring.** It clamps at both
ends (sidebar on the left, files on the right) instead of wrapping.
`prefix+h` from the sidebar and `prefix+l`/`F4` from files are no-ops.

**2026-07-17 — the relative chords are `prefix+h` (backward) and `prefix+l`
(forward), not j/k.** The three panes are laid out horizontally, so
left/right vim keys match the spatial direction.

**2026-07-14 — cross-pane navigation is relative and prefix-only.** `F4`
remains the direct forward-cycle alias. The former absolute `focus.numeric`
action and its `ctrl+h/j/k/l` / `prefix+h/j/k/l` chords were removed so those
Ctrl bytes reach the embedded engine. Existing `focus.numeric` YAML entries
are rejected as an unknown binding instead of being silently migrated to
different semantics.

## Task jump digits

**2026-07-29 — `ctrl+<digit>` jumps straight to a task, and is GLOBAL rather
than sidebar-scoped.** The whole value is switching tasks without leaving the
engine pane, so the digits are reserved out of terminal passthrough
(`RESERVED_GLOBAL_CHORDS`). The cost is the embedded shell's ctrl+digit
control bytes; the real escape and backspace keys are untouched.

**Each row prints the digit that jumps to it** (`panes/sidebar/jump-digits.ts`;
one list feeds the chord table, the handler, and the renderer). That is what
makes the feature usable rather than clever:

- `ctrl+1` does not exist. The legacy terminal protocol has no encoding for
  it (only ctrl+2…ctrl+8 map to C0 bytes; 1, 9 and 0 send nothing), verified
  on the owner's terminal. The first row prints, and answers to, `2`. Nobody
  computes an offset because the number is right there.
- Under the `recent` sort the list reorders as you switch, so the digits
  reorder with it. Reading them off the screen is the intended interaction:
  the digit is "where this task sits right now", not a permanent address. The
  task you are in sits at the top, so the digits read as distance from where
  you are.
- A row past the ninth prints no digit, and a chord with no row does nothing.
  A jump that silently lands somewhere else is worse than one that does
  nothing.

## The tree sidebar

**2026-08-01 — the tree never folds.** Every project and worktree always
shows everything under it — no twisties, no collapse state, no
Expand/Collapse menu entries. The tree is the map; hiding rows made it lie.

`sidebar.tree.open` (`l` / `space`) opens the row under the cursor, the same
thing `enter` does. On a tab row (the last level) that means entering the
tab's chat; the chord exists so the vim right-hand "go in" gesture works
without reaching for enter. `h` is unbound in the tree (there is no fold for
it to drive) and stays reserved. The chord replaced the withdrawn
`sidebar.tree.toggle` (`h`/`l`/`space`) proposal when the fold itself was
removed; the resolution is the owner's "no fold, `l` enters" directive, so no
further sign-off is pending.

The tree deliberately adds NO other chords. Two existing chords mean
something tree-shaped inside it:

- `/` (`sidebar.search.enter`) — the same search chord with a wider haystack:
  on top of a task's title + repo, a query also matches a worktree's branch
  and a tab's live title. Matches keep their ancestors so a hit is never
  orphaned from its project.
- `prefix+m` (`task.moveMode`) — the same global move mode, scope-aware
  since issue #43: `j`/`k` drag the cursor row at its **own level**. A tab
  row moves within its task's tab list (persisted in the tab snapshot), a
  task row moves within its repo group (`moveTask` partitions by repo), and
  a `main` row — the nearest navigable stand-in for the group header — drags
  the whole project, riding on `moveTask` reordering mains among mains. No
  new chord and no new daemon verb; every level stops at the edges (no
  wrap). A repo with no main checkout has no project row to move, and the
  chord is a silent no-op there.

Right-click on any row opens that row's menu. The entries are exactly what
the row's own chords already do, so the menu never becomes a second place
where behavior is decided — the one exception is the project header, which
the cursor cannot reach at all.

## Create PR

**2026-07-18 — `prefix+p` / `prefix+P`, global scope, no direct chord**
(superseding the 2026-07-17 files-scoped `ctrl+p`). The direct chord was
unreachable from where the owner actually sits: on the sidebar `ctrl+p` was
the project filter, and inside the terminal it passed through to the engine.
His muscle memory went to the prefix route, which was unbound (the HUD showed
`ctrl+a + shift+p ∅`). Both `p` and `shift+p` are bound because "PR" reads
uppercase and the capital press must land.

The handler also guards the target branch: firing it on a session sitting on
the PR base (a project main session) surfaces a toast instead of sending the
engine a doomed `gh pr create`.

## Other placements

- **2026-08-25 — Settings → Engines: `space` toggles an engine on/off,
  approved.** Dialog-scoped, beside the existing `r` / `x` / `d` engine
  letters, so it can shadow nothing outside Settings. `space` because it is
  the checkbox gesture and the row's `[x]` column is a checkbox; `enter` was
  equally acceptable to the owner but stays the row's primary action (edit
  the launch command), which is what makes the toggle a separate key rather
  than a mode.
- **2026-08-16 — Scratch shell gets NO chord; entry is the ctrl+e dialog's
  tail.** The PROPOSED `prefix+t` (issue #33 PR-2) was rejected: an unproven
  gesture doesn't earn a chord — Scratch entry joins the unified
  new-conversation dialog (`chat.tab.chooseEngine`) as a choice instead,
  reusing the real dialog per the "no simplified stand-in dialogs" rule.
  Placement inside the dialog is also deliberate: LAST in the choice
  sequence, after shell and plugin panes, with the default highlight and
  every existing choice's position untouched — `ctrl+e`→`enter` muscle
  memory must keep opening a fresh engine tab. Promotion to a direct or
  prefix chord (and forward in the sequence) waits on observed frequency.
- **2026-08-16 — the `[`/`]` archived-view cycle is retired, approved.**
  `sidebar.view` left with the Archived sidebar view (issue #33 PR-3): with
  one view there is nothing to cycle. The bracket pair returns to the free
  pool for the sidebar scope (`files.tab` keeps its own `[`/`]` in the files
  pane).
- **2026-07-27 — diff review letters** (`j/k`, `v`, `c`, `s`) are plain
  direct letters, diff-tab-scoped. They follow the same raw-binding precedent
  as the preview's `o` (system open), so they cannot shadow the composer,
  embedded terminals, or any other pane. The central table carries
  documentation-only rows (`diff.review.*`) so F1 and the legend list them.
- **2026-07-22 — splits are direct again**: `ctrl+\` (right) and `ctrl+=`
  (down). Their prefix strokes are dropped, same reasoning as the tab rows.
- **2026-07-17 — zen is prefix-only** (`prefix+z`); the old F6 direct chord
  is released to the shell.
- **2026-07-16 — move mode is `prefix+m`.**
- **2026-07-15 — the Inbox's `d`** (remove without navigating) is direct and
  dialog-scoped, because removal is a frequent, explicit cleanup action
  there; it cannot shadow input or embedded-terminal shortcuts outside the
  dialog.

## Plugin chords

**2026-07-28 — Rove ships no default plugin chords.** Every plugin chord is
the user's own placement call, so the catalogue/help surfaces don't list
them. They register at the workspace-host level with the same open-page
gating as global rows; a chord that shadows a catalogue binding applies with
a warning. Fire path is a detached `rove plugin pane open|action invoke` —
chord-fired actions have no terminal, so interactive pickers belong in panes.

## Discoverability surfaces

**2026-08-09** (terminal prefix reachability corrected 2026-08-10). Four
restrained surfaces teach the grammar. None re-implements the which-key map,
and all captions resolve through the live keymap
(`src/tui/lib/keyboard-hints.ts`), so a rebound chord shows its new key and
an unbound/disabled one drops out:

- **Status-bar micro-hint** — a permanent `{prefix} commands · F1 help ·
  [settings]` row in the workspace footer's right corner, including inside
  the embedded terminal. When no prefix action is reachable there, it falls
  back to the `ctrl+q` escape hatch; with a modal open, or the prefix
  disabled and help unbound, tokens drop until nothing renders. Every segment
  is mouse-activatable — clicking `commands` arms the REAL prefix (the guide
  accepts a keyboard second stroke), clicking the help caption opens F1, and
  the `[settings]` button opens Settings even while the terminal owns
  keyboard input, since mouse clicks never pass through.
- **First-use pane hints** — one muted line per vim-style pane (sidebar:
  `j/k move · ⏎ open`; files: move/fold/open/diff). Using that pane's own
  nav/select keys extinguishes its line permanently; the files pane then
  falls back to its short permanent `⏎ open · d diff` footer.
- **Onboarding wizard "Keyboard basics" page** — one informational screen
  after the first-run questions (skippable with the wizard).
- **Settings** — General → "Keyboard hints" toggles all hint surfaces
  (re-enabling relights extinguished pane hints); Keybindings keeps a
  one-paragraph grammar summary with the live prefix/timeout values.

Hints are text-only on the ambient background (no opaque fill), so normal and
transparent themes both stay readable — pinned by
`test/tui-react/keyboard-overlay-theme.test.ts` and the `/harness` visual
journey `keyboard hints render and extinguish in the real OpenTUI`.

## Adding or moving a chord

Get owner sign-off on direct versus prefix placement, the selected key, and
any engine/terminal shortcut it may shadow. Then:

1. Add or change the stable binding row in `tui/context/keybindings-*.ts`.
2. Register its handler at the narrowest correct focused surface.
3. Check conflicts across direct and prefix forms.
4. Update F1 localization, focused tests, and
   [`../KEYBINDINGS.md`](../KEYBINDINGS.md) when the default vocabulary
   changes.
5. Verify terminal passthrough for unclaimed keys.
6. Record the resolution and its reasoning in this file.
