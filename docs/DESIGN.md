# Rove design

## Mission

Give one developer a terminal-native control plane for many parallel AI coding
tasks. Conductor is the layout reference—task rail, workspace, files/diffs,
status—but Rove is local-first and runs the real interactive engine CLIs.

## Principles

### 1. Engine CLIs are products

Claude Code, Codex, Copilot CLI, and custom engines own authentication,
prompts, approvals, rendering, and model execution. Rove embeds their real
interactive interfaces in Hosted PTYs; it does not re-render model streams or
call raw model APIs.

Engine adapters remain the one pluggability seam for identity, launch argv,
capabilities, model/effort catalogs, history, completion markers, and telemetry
normalization. Neutral layers never hard-code vendor UI data.

### 2. Managed Tasks are the isolation unit

```text
Managed task = git worktree + branch + terminal tabs
```

A managed Task owns one Worktree and may own several Terminal Tabs. Project-main
Tasks reuse the saved repository checkout; directory Tasks reuse a user-owned
directory. Those two variants do not own a Rove-created worktree or branch.

Explicit delete is kind-aware: the main row's delete action forgets the saved
project while keeping its repository and managed Tasks, a directory Task
removes only its Rove record, and a managed Task removes its Worktree after
the dirty-worktree safety check before attempting to remove its task branch.

### 3. Process ownership is explicit

- The Daemon owns Task/Worktree control-plane state.
- The standalone PTY Host owns interactive child lifetime and output buffers.
- The `rove web` Node PTY sidecar owns browser-created terminal children only.
- The Workspace Host attaches and renders; closing it detaches only.

This separation makes live engine sessions survive TUI exits and daemon
restarts. The standalone host also freezes bounded terminal state so host
restarts and reboots can restore the screen and relaunch on attach. TUI/API
sessions have one standalone-host backend and one launch behavior; the frozen
browser dashboard's Node PTY sidecar is a separate maintenance boundary.

### 4. State stays with its natural owner

Engine conversation history stays in engine-owned files. Git state stays in
git. Rove persists its Task index, UI/settings manifest, and bounded Hosted PTY
recovery/abnormal-exit diagnostics. Those terminal stores preserve viewport
continuity and crash evidence, not engine conversation history. Do not copy
derivable engine or repository state into a second database.

### 5. Terminal-native is a feature

Rove composes with shell tools, SSH, `git`, `gh`, and `jq`. It accepts the
terminal's visual constraints. Fundamentally graphical work should open an
external application rather than grow a poor terminal imitation.

### 6. Reuse proven primitives

Use the locked stack: TypeScript, Bun, React 19, `@opentui/core`, and
`@opentui/react`. Study the read-only `refs/` projects before replacing a
proven parser, terminal primitive, history reader, or interaction pattern.

## UI rules

- Yoga flexbox first. Ratios use flex growth, not hardcoded pixel-like widths.
- The live Binding Stack is focus- and modal-aware. The embedded engine gets
  every unclaimed key.
- React components render and wire events; reusable policy/state lives in
  framework-free `src/tui/**` modules.
- User-visible engine identity and capability data comes from the engine
  registry.

## Performance rules

Render paths never run synchronous subprocesses. Recurring repository reads use
bounded async pollers with in-flight dedupe, timeout, and backoff. One-shot UI
actions use async subprocesses.

Long-lived lists preserve row identity: suppress no-op updates and reconcile
unchanged row objects so the renderer does not churn native objects on every
poll or filesystem event.

CI enforces the sync-subprocess rule, operation-count budgets, touched-file
coverage, and the roughly 500-line source-file cap.

## Failure behavior

- A missing Daemon is surfaced or restarted at the composition boundary.
- A missing PTY Host is started for session-creating operations.
- A stale canonical session is recovered explicitly; never create a second
  implicit engine key.
- Task teardown is idempotent when the PTY Host is absent or already stopped.
- UI polling failures keep the last good value instead of blocking or crashing.

## Historical decisions

Superseded design records under `docs/design/` and historical CHANGELOG entries
may describe older architectures. They are context, not current implementation
instructions. Current ownership and vocabulary live in
[CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).
