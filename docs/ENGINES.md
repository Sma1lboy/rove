# Engines

An **engine** is the AI coding CLI a task runs on: `claude`, `codex`,
`copilot`, `kimi`, or one you register yourself. Rove runs the real
interactive CLI inside the task's terminal session.

```text
Managed task = one git worktree + one branch + one or more terminal tabs
```

A Task can own several terminal tabs. Each engine tab has its own PTY process
and conversation, but opening another engine or shell tab does **not** create
another worktree: ordinary sibling tabs use the same Task directory. Two agents in
sibling tabs can therefore edit each other's work; create another task when
you need git-level isolation and a separate branch.

## Which engines are supported

| Engine | Id | Account detect | Activity badge | History | Model picker |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Codex | `codex` | ✓ | ✓ (after you trust hooks) | ✓ | ✓ + effort levels |
| GitHub Copilot | `copilot` | ✓ | ✓ (screen-based) | ✓ | — |
| Kimi Code | `kimi` | ✓ | ✓ | handoff only | — |
| Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Cursor Agent, Grok CLI, Droid, Amp | contrib | binary only | ✓ (screen-based) | — | — |
| Anything you register | custom | binary only | — | — | — |

**Claude Code is the default** and the most complete: its quota probe drives
rate-limit auto-resume and the Settings usage dashboard.

**Contrib engines are launch + badge only.** Rove ships a catalog of
well-known coding CLIs (`gemini`, `opencode`, `cursor`, `grok`, `droid`,
`amp`) so they appear in the engine selector whenever the binary is on your
PATH, with a proper name, a launch command, and screen-based activity
badges. Settings → Engines lists them (and your own registered engines) with
their binary discovery, and that is all detection can answer for them. No
login state, history, or model picker; those need a real adapter, which is
what promotes an engine to built-in.

**Kimi is partial.** Rove finds the binary, reads its login state, and can
locate each session's transcript, enough to watch it for activity and to
hand the conversation to another engine. It still doesn't *parse* that
transcript (the wire format is unverified), so auto-title keeps the
placeholder and `rove api read-output` reports `engine_unsupported` rather
than guessing.

## Picking an engine

Per task, at creation time, or with `v` in the sidebar. The default for new
tasks comes from Settings → Engines (`defaultVendor`), and Rove remembers the
last engine you used per project. From a script it is
`rove api add --command <engine-or-command-line>`; see
[engine presets and protocols](#engine-presets-and-protocols).

Engines whose CLI isn't installed are hidden from the new-task dialog. Custom
engines always show; you added it, so Rove assumes you meant it.

### Reasoning effort

Codex accepts `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, passed as
`-c model_reasoning_effort=<level>`. Other engines have no effort flag Rove
can drive; a selected effort is ignored there rather than passed through.

### Workspace trust

Claude, Codex, and Kimi each gate a first launch in a never-seen directory
behind a trust dialog, and every task worktree is such a directory, so a
hosted session can't answer it (Kimi's dialog even exits the process when a
pasted first message lands on "Don't trust"). Before spawning an engine into
a Rove-created worktree, Rove writes the vendor's own trust record for that
path (`~/.claude.json` `projects[<path>].hasTrustDialogAccepted`,
`~/.codex/config.toml` `[projects."<path>"] trust_level = "trusted"`, or
`~/.kimi-code/workspace-trust/`), merging into existing entries, never
clobbering. This only ever fires for worktrees Rove itself created from a
repo you already work in; your own directories are untouched.

### Custom launch commands

Override any engine's launch command in Settings → Engines, or by hand in
`state.json`:

```json
{ "engineCommand.claude": "claude --model opus" }
```

Quotes are honored, so `claude --append-system-prompt "be terse"` works. For
Claude, Rove appends its own `--session-id` so the tab stays resumable. If
your override already pins the conversation (`--session-id`, `--resume`,
`--continue`, `--from-pr`), Rove leaves it alone.

If an engine exits non-zero, the terminal stays open with a banner pointing
at Settings → Engines, and drops you into a shell.

## Activity badges

The sidebar shows what each session is doing: **working**, **done**, or
**needs input**. There's nothing to configure. Rove reads the engine's own
hook events, falling back to its transcript when hooks aren't available.

One thing worth knowing: **the depth of the badge depends on the engine**.
Claude, codex, and kimi report through hooks: the full working / done /
needs-input vocabulary, sub-second. Engines without hooks or a readable
transcript (copilot today) fall back to screen reading: Rove classifies the
visible terminal against engine-declared rules, which still distinguishes
working from waiting-on-you but can't see a completed turn the way a
transcript marker can. Rove labels the gap honestly rather than guessing.

Codex won't run Rove's hooks until you trust them once via `/hooks`, so Codex
badges stay dark until you approve. That's by design: Rove writes the hook
definition but never bypasses the trust prompt for you.

Mechanics: [design/engine-internals.md](./design/engine-internals.md).

## Resuming and forking

**Resume.** A Claude tab whose process is gone (reboot, unarchive) relaunches
into the same conversation instead of a blank one. A tab that never sent a
first message isn't resumed; there's no transcript yet. Codex, Copilot,
Kimi, and custom engines can't take a caller-set session id, so their tabs
relaunch fresh.

`ctrl+a` `y` opens the resume picker for the active task.

**Continue in a new tab.** `ctrl+a` `c` opens the continuation flow in the
*same* worktree. What happens depends on the source and destination engines:

*Same engine* → a native fork only when that CLI can actually branch a
conversation. The two resulting tabs keep the source context and then diverge:

| Engine | Native fork? | How |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | ✓ | `--resume <src> --fork-session` |
| `codex` | ✓ | `codex fork <src>` |
| `copilot` | — | starts a fresh Copilot session with a transcript handoff |
| `kimi` | — | starts a fresh Kimi session with a transcript handoff |
| custom | — | refused; Rove doesn't know its session store |

Copilot's `--resume` and Kimi's `-S` reopen rather than branch, which would put
two live processes on one transcript. Rove therefore uses the same transcript
handoff as a cross-engine continuation: the new tab is a fresh conversation
that reads where the previous one stopped. A custom engine without a known
session store is refused instead of silently opening a blank continuation.

*Different built-in engine* → a handoff. This is the move that saves you when
you hit a usage limit mid-task. The new engine starts fresh with a first prompt
that points it at the old session's transcript and asks it to state where the
previous one stopped. That sentence is how you check the handoff landed.

Handoffs work in every direction between the four built-ins. The receiving
agent is handed the previous transcript's *path* and reads it in whatever
format it finds, so no format ever has to be converted. Only a **custom**
engine can't be a handoff source (Rove doesn't know its session store); that
case is refused with a reason. A handoff *to* a custom engine works fine.

## Custom engines

Any CLI can be an engine. A custom engine is a **named preset**: an id, a
launch command, an optional display name, and, declared once at
registration, the *protocol* Rove speaks to it. **Settings → Engines → + Add
engine** asks for each. Or by hand:

```json
{
  "customEngineIds": ["aider"],
  "engineCommand.aider": "aider --model sonnet",
  "engineName.aider": "Aider",
  "engineProtocol.aider": "claude"
}
```

Being in `customEngineIds` *is* the registration.

`engineProtocol.<id>` is optional and says "talk to my binary the way you talk
to `claude`". Set it when your CLI is a wrapper around a built-in (a
different binary name, a fixed set of flags, a company shim) so the transcript
reader, workspace-trust pre-answer, and first-message delivery all apply.
Leave it out and the preset gets the **generic** protocol: it launches and
runs fine, but Rove reads no history, pre-answers no trust dialog, and falls
back to silence-window liveness with settle-then-paste delivery.

Press `x` on an engine row in Settings to reset a built-in's overrides, or
remove a custom engine entirely.

## Engine presets and protocols

Rove separates two things a "vendor" used to conflate:

- **the command.** What actually runs. A preset id (`claude`) or a full
  command line (`codex --search`). Nothing validates its flags; probe an
  unfamiliar CLI with `<cmd> --help` first.
- **the protocol.** Which adapter Rove uses for that command: whose
  transcripts to read, whose trust store to pre-answer, whether the first
  message may ride the launch argv.

The protocol is **derived** from the command, never declared beside it:

1. `argv[0]` names a registered preset (built-in or yours) → that preset's
   protocol. Deterministic, and it answers before anything spawns. This is
   the normal path.
2. Otherwise Rove can recognise a known engine binary through wrappers
   (`env FOO=1 claude`, `node …/codex.js`), the same walk the process probe
   uses at runtime.
3. Neither → **generic**, described above.

`rove api engine-list` prints every entry with its raw command and resolved
protocol; copy one into `rove api add --command` verbatim, or edit a flag
first. See [API.md](./API.md) for the dispatch verbs.

## Where conversations are stored

Engines own their own history. Rove reads it, never writes it.

| Engine | Transcripts |
|---|---|
| `claude` | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<sessionId>.jsonl` |
| `codex` | `~/.codex/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/rollout-*.jsonl` |
| `copilot` | `~/.copilot/session-state/<id>/events.jsonl` |
| `kimi` | `~/.kimi-code/sessions/<workspace>/<session>/agents/main/wire.jsonl` |

That's why a crash never loses a conversation, and why history survives
`rove reset` and a machine reboot.
